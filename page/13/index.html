With joy and pride I am excited to announce that yesterday I successfully made the last step towards my bachelor degree in <a href="http://www.feri.uni-mb.si/podrocje.aspx?id=92">Media Communications</a>. Yesterday I presented my <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/ialja/.cv/ialja/Sites/.Public/Diploma_AljaSulcic.pdf-zip.zip">diploma work</a> (dealing with the role of online tutors in e-learning) at <a href="http://www.feri.uni-mb.si/podrocje.aspx?id=0&langid=1033">my faculty</a>, and officially became the first Slovenian graduate in Media Communications <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(the news even got some </span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://www.vecer.si/clanek2007060205209467">press coverage</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">)</span>. I was among the first generation of this new study, and although being the first to deal with this relatively new subject was not always easy, I&#8217;m really satisfied that my undergraduate study is finally over. Despite many problems, I&#8217;ve learned quite some new things, especially about the characteristic of communication, informatics, and graphic design that I will able to use in my future work.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RmEflQOtFWI/AAAAAAAAAFc/wuF3TAgeFcw/s1600-h/diploma.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 273px; height: 238px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RmEflQOtFWI/AAAAAAAAAFc/wuF3TAgeFcw/s320/diploma.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5071369380268152162" border="0" /></a><div align="center"><i><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">During yesterday&#8217;s presentation</span></i></div>Now I&#8217;m of course already looking towards the future and searching for an interesting postgraduate study program.

I&#8217;ve been completely busy in the past few days, but today I&#8217;ve really got to share something with you. You know I&#8217;m a huge fan of <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a>, but today I came across (via <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2007/05/30/microsoft-launches-multitouch-surface-computing/">Mac Rumors</a>) a video presentation of a brand new <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> product - Microsoft Surface - that just took my breath away. It&#8217;s a multi-user multi-touch 30in-ch display on which your fingers do the magic. No mouse, just playing around with your hands or other objects. I suggest checking out  the <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/industry/4217348.html">first look article with video</a> at Popularmechanics.com, which explains the capabilities of this new product in more detail, and the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/">official Microsoft Surface site</a>.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/Rl0cRgOtFVI/AAAAAAAAAFU/r-ijxeH1-j4/s1600-h/MS-surface.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 287px; height: 218px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/Rl0cRgOtFVI/AAAAAAAAAFU/r-ijxeH1-j4/s320/MS-surface.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5070239842524009810" border="0" /></a>Finally, the technology we&#8217;ve been waiting for years is a step closer to the consumers! Of course, it will be a quite expensive, but it&#8217;s a step in the right direction. I know I will have to wait to get my hand on one of these surface computers for quite a while, but I can already see many great things one could use such a computer for, can&#8217;t you? :) This time it&#8217;s definitely thumbs up for Microsoft!<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/05/surface-computing-has-arrived.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/05/surface-computing-has-arrived.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Hello world! Today I finally returned online after an offline week in Egypt (how was it? Well, let me just say that the words &#8220;hot weather&#8221; now have an entirely new meaning for me :) ). And I already spent most of the morning answering e-mails, sending out Joost invites <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(if you need one for yourself or your friends you can still mail me - ialja(at)mac(dot)com)</span>, updating Second Life, and getting through messages from various Web 2.0 sites. While I was gone <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ialja/sloodle-presentation/">my Sloodle presentation</a> even became <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/featured">featured on Slideshare</a>! I guess it shows that the Web 2.0 never sleeps :)<br /><br />For me the past week has been quite odd. Time passed slowly, and differently. I spent an entire week without using a computer, and even with limited use of my cell phone. It was strange, but in a way it was good to take a short break. The only problem is that I&#8217;ve got so much to catch up on :( This week will be also very busy for me, so I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll manage to post to my blog in the next days. I know I still have some blog homework to do, but I&#8217;m afraid it will have to wait for at least another week&#8230; Until then you can take a look at some photos from <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/ialja/sets/72157600275805854/">my vacation on Flickr</a>.<br /><div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/517391456/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/208/517391456_77b64b70f6_m.jpg" alt="Camel riding" height="180" width="240" /></a></div>Yeah, I know, I am quite hopeless: one of the first things I did upon my return was to upload some photos to Flickr. Yup, it&#8217;s good to be back! :)  So&#8230; stay tuned ;)<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/05/back-from-offline-week.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/05/back-from-offline-week.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

The Moot was hosted at <a href="http://www.fm-kp.si/eng/">my faculty</a>, and we had over 60 delegates from all over our country (and also abroad). We were able to listen to over 30 interesting presentations, during which we learned about how <a href="http://www.moodle.org/">Moodle</a> is being used in different schools, at different levels, and for different course subjects. It was also a great opportunity to meet new people, exchange ideas, and also have a great time on the Slovenian coast (we managed to arrange a nice, warm and sunny day ;) ).<br /><br />Most of the conference was in Slovenian, but we also had an international section, in which our Austrian and Italian friends presented their work. I was especially excited about having our <a href="http://www.act2win.com/">Austrian friends</a> over, whom we actually met through <a href="http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=65151">moodle.org</a>! Thank you so much <a href="http://www.act2win.com/index.php?id=ps0">Peter</a> and <a href="http://www.act2win.com/index.php?id=team0&no_cache=1&amp;sword_list%5B%5D=sabrina&sword_list%5B%5D=ovcak">Sabrina</a> for coming and presenting some of your work! :)<br /><br />Here is a photo from the beginning of the international section, with me as the section moderator, and Peter and Sabrina preparing for their presentation, which was supported by <a href="http://www.persony.com/">Persony</a>, a really great web conferencing tool:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/Rk7n6AOtFTI/AAAAAAAAAFE/K7tC68QrQNg/s1600-h/DSC_0025_w.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/Rk7n6AOtFTI/AAAAAAAAAFE/K7tC68QrQNg/s320/DSC_0025_w.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5066241614518490418" border="0" /></a><div align="center"><i>Photo by Alen Ježovnik</i></div><br />At the conference I also presented my own paper on the subject of <a href="http://www.sloodle.com/">Sloodle</a>. My presentation was the last of the day, and I think I did a decent job - judging from the feedback from the audience and their questions :) After the conference I also had a brief presentation of <a href="http://www.secondlife.com/">Second Life</a> for those that were interested, and I hope I managed to present the existing potential of virtual worlds well enough.<br /><br />So, the event was delivered without any major problems, and I think that all of our delegates were able to find something useful at our first Moodle Moot. I definitely hope we&#8217;ll have another event like this again in the next year.<br /><br />I&#8217;d like to finish this report by posting my own Sloodle presentation, and the two videos I&#8217;ve used during my presentation (I only had 10 minutes to present everything, so I had to keep the videos short). Here are the slides I used (translated in English):<br /><div align="center"><object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="https://s3.amazonaws.com:443/slideshare/ssplayer.swf?id=51939&doc=sloodle-presentation-6650" height="348" width="425"><param name="movie" value="https://s3.amazonaws.com:443/slideshare/ssplayer.swf?id=51939&amp;doc=sloodle-presentation-6650"></object></div><br />A short video about Second Life (it was played on slide 3):<br /><div align="center"><object height="350" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/tKyU0cj7dcE"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/tKyU0cj7dcE" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="350" width="425"></embed></object></div><br />And a short demonstration of how the Sloodle Toolbar works (played on slide 7):<br /><div align="center"><object height="350" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/7fOpqdHaU18"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/7fOpqdHaU18" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="350" width="425"></embed></object></div><br /><span style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192);">(By the way: we also had my <a href="/2007/05/moodle-presentation-feedback-needed.html">Moodle presentation video</a> playing in the coffee room and before the start of the conference.)</span><br /><br />If you&#8217;d like to know more about our conference or my presentation, please leave a comment here or email me (ialja(at)mac(dot)com).<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/05/report-first-slovenian-moodle-moot.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/05/report-first-slovenian-moodle-moot.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

Tonight I&#8217;m leaving for a short vacation in Egypt, so I&#8217;ll probably be offline for the next week (from May 20th until May 27th). That means there will be no new posts on my blogs, and that I will be unable to send you <a href="/2007/05/joost-tv-way-you-want-it-well-almost.html">Joost invites</a> in the next week (but if you don&#8217;t mind the wait feel free to send me a request by email and I&#8217;ll respond when I get back). If you mail me (ialja(at)mac(dot)com) or IM me in Second Life I&#8217;ll get back to you after my return. I&#8217;ll try to bring some nice pictures with me :)<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://slbestpractices2007.wikispaces.com/"><img style="margin: 0pt 5px 0px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 125px; height: 83px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/Rj67Ov4CDEI/AAAAAAAAAE8/tYtSKLKTbME/s320/SLbestpractices07.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>Unfortunately I&#8217;ll miss the <a href="http://slbestpractices2007.wikispaces.com/">Second Life Best Practices Conference</a>, so I tried to contributed my part in advance by making the conference logo. I hope many of you will attend the event in my place, and I&#8217;m looking forward to read some great blog posts about the event and seeing some nice pictures on Flickr :)<br /><br />I will certainly be back online and in-world in one week. Upon my return I will also write my goals (I&#8217;ve just <a href="http://onlinesapiens.com/blog/2007/05/19/my-goals-gotta-get-goals-meme/">been tagged</a> for the first time :) ), so stay tuned!<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/05/out-of-office-notice.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/05/out-of-office-notice.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

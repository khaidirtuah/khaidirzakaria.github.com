  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
A few days ago I was watching <a href="http://cis.paisley.ac.uk/livi-ci0/">Daniel</a> <a href="http://learninggames.wordpress.com/">Livingstone</a>&#8217;s presentation <a href="http://slisweb.sjsu.edu/">Immersive and Web-Based Virtual Learning Environments</a>, and although most of the things he talked about were not new to me, it did strike me that teaching in Second Life at the moment is no piece of cake if you don&#8217;t have certain technical skills. <a href="http://www.sloodle.com/">Sloodle</a> is an interesting project that tries to make <a href="http://www.secondlife.com/">Second Life </a>more teacher friendly, but can you imagine an average teacher <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">(who has already struggled to learn how to use </span><a style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);" href="http://www.moodle.org/">Moodle</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">)</span> installing Sloodle and setting it up with his or her own Moodle site? Or setting up a quiz for students within Second Life by finding and modifying a quiz script? I honestly can&#8217;t, and I think that until we can make teaching in Second Life as easy as using a web-based learning system like Moodle, I don&#8217;t think we can expect a lot of existing teachers to do any serious teaching in Second Life <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(for the sake of the argument let&#8217;s just say that Second Life (or a similar virtual world) is an environment we want to use in education, and that we want to have our teachers to teach in it)</span>. You all probably know that it&#8217;s difficult enough to explain what Second Life is all about, not to mention convincing teachers to get an account and get seriously involved in it!<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/564338935/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1390/564338935_65e03b57ac_m.jpg" alt="Teaching in Second Life can be confusing" height="173" width="240" /></a><br /></div>So, what would we need to make Second Life more teacher friendly and consequently more student friendly? I think the best way to achieve that would be to <span style="font-weight: bold;">integrate some teaching and learning tools</span> right into the Second Life (or any other virtual world) client. Let me give you an example of how that could look like.<br /><br />First, a quick look back in time. The things we have to do right now in Second Life to set up a quiz or a similar activity remind me of the internet in the middle of the nineties. Back then, internet was a cool thing tool that most people were still unaware or even afraid of. It was really cool to have your own website, but it was not easy. You had to get some server space, learn HTML <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(remember how proud we were when we managed to use frames? ;) )</span>, and then you had to know how to upload files. Argh. Only the real enthusiasts bothered to learn all that. Compare that with the ease with which you can nowadays create (and publish) a website in <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/iweb/">iWeb</a> or the wonderful one click web publishing - everything is so easy that even my grandfather was able to learn how to blog in a few hours! And that&#8217;s just how Second Life should become if we want more people to adopt it. We need better interfaces, more interactivity, and the ability to create content without the need to edit the scripts directly. Everything should be as easy as blogging with the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fOpqdHaU18">Sloodle Toolbar</a> currently is <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(well, once you manage to set it up :) )</span>.<br /><br />What we&#8217;d need is a user-friendly tool with which we could manage our courses. The best would be if learning management tools were available right in Second Life - in a similar way that group administration works right now. Can you image how great it would be if we had an extra &#8221;<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Learning</span>&#8221; button somewhere in the SL interface? This button could open a list of all courses an avatar is currently attending or teaching. With a few clicks, you could get more info on each of our courses, search for new courses, start your own course etc.. Right now there are already many interesting courses that are being taught in Second Life <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">(not just by educational institutions, but also by individual residents),</span> but no easy way to find them and keep track of them.<br /><div> </div><div><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/564338661/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1146/564338661_fea7569164_m.jpg" alt="Learning and Teaching in Second Life" height="206" width="240" /></a><br /></div>I think every Second Life resident should be able to set up a course - pretty much like you can create your own group. Linden Labs could charge a small fee to open a course (as it does with groups), and have special discounts for large educational institutions that provide more courses. As a <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">teacher</span> of a course you should be able to change some basic settings, manage the list of participants (students and teachers/tutors) in each course, make course materials and notes available to students, have a list of assignments with deadlines and grades, have the ability to view attendance stats in your virtual classroom (a certain space on a land you or your institution owns), have the ability to set up and rez objects that contain a certain script with a few clicks without having to manually edit the script (a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMD9QTdyIHk">quiz chair</a> for example or and info point for students) etc. Of course, it&#8217;d be great if you could connect this teacher tool to other learning environments (Moodle or others) with just a few clicks, and even able to view and edit the content of SL courses on the web. They say that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_picture_is_worth_a_thousand_words">a picture is worth a thousand words</a>, so let&#8217;s try to imagine how such a tool <span style="font-style: italic;">could</span> look like:<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/564339121/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1360/564339121_fa15260d5d_m.jpg" alt="Course management in Second Life" height="173" width="240" /></a><br /></div>And then of course, <span style="font-weight: bold;">students</span> should in my opinion also get some help to keep track of their courses in the 3D virtual environment. They should be able to view basic course materials, send messages to the teacher and other students (either using the virtual world&#8217;s IM channels or maybe even send IMs to other chat clients outside the virtual world - <a href="http://www.skype.com/">Skype</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/talk/">Google Talk</a>, <a href="http://www.icq.com/">ICQ</a> etc.), get reminded of upcoming lessons (wouldn&#8217;t it be great if you were automatically offered a teleport to the class location 5 minutes before the start of the lesson?), receive notices of changes, have the ability to upload reports, write posts, answer quizzes, rate courses etc.  Of course, the content of all their courses should also be accessible through a web browser and on any mobile device.<br /><br /></div><div>These are just a few ideas of how I think future teacher/students tools in 3D online virtual worlds should look like. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;d be a good idea to build an education-only virtual world (some sort of 3D Moodle) that focuses just on education - at least not until our avatars are able to travel between different worlds with all their luggage. In my opinion we need to provide better support for education in existing virtual worlds - education is after all one of the very important aspects of our lives, so why shouldn&#8217;t it be more visible and better supported in the so called real-life simulations? I hope we will start seeing more tools like this soon, and that providing such tools will make second life easier for both &#8220;virtual&#8221; teachers and students. As virtual worlds are slowly making their way into mainstream and evolving in more open and connected spaces we now have the opportunity <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(and perhaps even a moral obligation)</span> to bring out our own ideas about the future of education in virtual worlds and also demand better support for teachers and students in these new environments. That is why I would like to end this post by asking you, dear reader, this question:<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; color: rgb(70, 122, 167);"><span style="font-weight: bold;">What do you personally think should the killer app or tool for teaching in virtual worlds be like if it were to bring 3D immersive environments a step closer to the average teacher and make studying in these environments easier to follow for learners?</span><br /></div></div><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/06/how-could-we-make-second-life-more.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/06/how-could-we-make-second-life-more.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

I admit: I&#8217;ve been a bad blogger lately. I&#8217;ve been tagged for my first blog <a href="http://thedailymeme.com/what-is-a-meme/">meme</a> over 3 weeks ago, and I still haven&#8217;t done my homework :blushes: I&#8217;m glad that I can now finally take some time to add my post to the <a href="http://www.alexshalman.com/blog/2007/03/23/gotta-get-goals">Gotta Get Goals Meme</a>, for which I was tagged by <a href="http://onlinesapiens.com/blog/2007/05/19/my-goals-gotta-get-goals-meme/">Eduardo Peirano</a> <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(also, check out his </span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://college2.ning.com/">College 2.0</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);"> network on </span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://www.ning.com/">Ning</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">)</span>, who also wanted to learn about my goals.<br /><br />I admit it took me some time to write this post. I&#8217;m in a way at a turning point of my life - just got my bachelor degree, and now I&#8217;m trying to get a full time job and continue with my formal education. And although I&#8217;ll probably continue in the field I&#8217;m already so involved in, it certainly is a good time for me to think about goals, and all the things I&#8217;d like to do in the future.<br /><div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/540752325/" title="Photo Sharing"><img style="width: 490px; height: 208px;" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1289/540752325_9cdeed8b4f.jpg" alt="Gotta Get Goals" /></a></div>So, after much thought, I have decided that these are the most interesting goals for me right now:<br /><ul><li>I&#8217;d like <span style="font-weight: bold;">stay on track</span> with recent developments and best practices in the the field of e-learning, and also in other fields that can help me with my work or are just interesting for me (for example informatics, psychology, communication science, marketing, graphic design,&#8230;). My goal is to keep my eyes open for new discoveries, to keep reading, keep asking questions, meeting new people, learning something new every single day, and trying to apply new knowledge both to my professional and personal life.</li><li>I&#8217;d also like to <span style="font-weight: bold;">continue with my formal education</span>. My goal is to find a good online master and later a doctoral program connected with e-learning, during which I&#8217;ll be able to improve myself as an online learner, and of course continue to reflect on my work as an online tutor.<br /></li><li>I&#8217;d like to continuously <span style="font-weight: bold;">improve my tutoring and teaching skills</span>, and try to share my passion for my work with my students, colleagues, and anybody else that is willing to listen ;) With that I&#8217;d like to inspire people to discover new things that are not necessarily related to a single course subject, and to start viewing the process of learning as a daily activity and not just as part of a formal educational setting.</li><li>I&#8217;m my lifetime I&#8217;d also like to <span style="font-weight: bold;">learn another foreign language </span>- currently I know English and Italian (although I need to improve my speaking and writing skills in Italian!), and I would once like to learn a language that is completely different from the languages that I already know. Currently, Japanese looks the most tempting for me. Why? Because it is something entirely new, because it&#8217;d also give me the opportunity to get to know a different culture, and because it would enable me to watch Japanese <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime">anime</a> in the original language :)</li><li>I&#8217;d also to <span style="font-weight: bold;">continue blogging </span>and make my blog an interesting place to visit at least once a week :) Although blogging takes a lot of time and effort, it gives back so many wonderful rewards that I certainly hope I&#8217;ll be able to actively use my blog as my starting point for learning for as long as possible.<br /></li><li>And at last but certainly not least, I&#8217;d also like to <span style="font-weight: bold;">continue making the lives of people closest to me</span> <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(my family and closest friends - you know who you are)</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">brighter</span> with tiny thoughtful displays of affection that show them that I care about them and that they are special for me. By doing this I&#8217;d also like to thank them day by day for all their love and support - because that in the end is what fuels all my passions and makes me go on.</li></ul><a href="http://onlinesapiens.com/blog/2007/05/19/my-goals-gotta-get-goals-meme/">Eduardo</a> already tagged some people I&#8217;d have wanted to tag, but one person he didn&#8217;t tag, and I would like to learn more about, is <a href="http://webtoolsforlearners.blogspot.com/">Joan</a> <a href="http://eduspaces.net/vinall/weblog/">Vinall-Cox</a>.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/06/gotta-get-goals-meme.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/06/gotta-get-goals-meme.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

With joy and pride I am excited to announce that yesterday I successfully made the last step towards my bachelor degree in <a href="http://www.feri.uni-mb.si/podrocje.aspx?id=92">Media Communications</a>. Yesterday I presented my <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/ialja/.cv/ialja/Sites/.Public/Diploma_AljaSulcic.pdf-zip.zip">diploma work</a> (dealing with the role of online tutors in e-learning) at <a href="http://www.feri.uni-mb.si/podrocje.aspx?id=0&langid=1033">my faculty</a>, and officially became the first Slovenian graduate in Media Communications <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(the news even got some </span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://www.vecer.si/clanek2007060205209467">press coverage</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">)</span>. I was among the first generation of this new study, and although being the first to deal with this relatively new subject was not always easy, I&#8217;m really satisfied that my undergraduate study is finally over. Despite many problems, I&#8217;ve learned quite some new things, especially about the characteristic of communication, informatics, and graphic design that I will able to use in my future work.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RmEflQOtFWI/AAAAAAAAAFc/wuF3TAgeFcw/s1600-h/diploma.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 273px; height: 238px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RmEflQOtFWI/AAAAAAAAAFc/wuF3TAgeFcw/s320/diploma.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5071369380268152162" border="0" /></a><div align="center"><i><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">During yesterday&#8217;s presentation</span></i></div>Now I&#8217;m of course already looking towards the future and searching for an interesting postgraduate study program.

I&#8217;ve been completely busy in the past few days, but today I&#8217;ve really got to share something with you. You know I&#8217;m a huge fan of <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a>, but today I came across (via <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2007/05/30/microsoft-launches-multitouch-surface-computing/">Mac Rumors</a>) a video presentation of a brand new <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> product - Microsoft Surface - that just took my breath away. It&#8217;s a multi-user multi-touch 30in-ch display on which your fingers do the magic. No mouse, just playing around with your hands or other objects. I suggest checking out  the <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/industry/4217348.html">first look article with video</a> at Popularmechanics.com, which explains the capabilities of this new product in more detail, and the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/">official Microsoft Surface site</a>.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/Rl0cRgOtFVI/AAAAAAAAAFU/r-ijxeH1-j4/s1600-h/MS-surface.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 287px; height: 218px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/Rl0cRgOtFVI/AAAAAAAAAFU/r-ijxeH1-j4/s320/MS-surface.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5070239842524009810" border="0" /></a>Finally, the technology we&#8217;ve been waiting for years is a step closer to the consumers! Of course, it will be a quite expensive, but it&#8217;s a step in the right direction. I know I will have to wait to get my hand on one of these surface computers for quite a while, but I can already see many great things one could use such a computer for, can&#8217;t you? :) This time it&#8217;s definitely thumbs up for Microsoft!<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/05/surface-computing-has-arrived.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/05/surface-computing-has-arrived.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

Hello world! Today I finally returned online after an offline week in Egypt (how was it? Well, let me just say that the words &#8220;hot weather&#8221; now have an entirely new meaning for me :) ). And I already spent most of the morning answering e-mails, sending out Joost invites <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(if you need one for yourself or your friends you can still mail me - ialja(at)mac(dot)com)</span>, updating Second Life, and getting through messages from various Web 2.0 sites. While I was gone <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ialja/sloodle-presentation/">my Sloodle presentation</a> even became <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/featured">featured on Slideshare</a>! I guess it shows that the Web 2.0 never sleeps :)<br /><br />For me the past week has been quite odd. Time passed slowly, and differently. I spent an entire week without using a computer, and even with limited use of my cell phone. It was strange, but in a way it was good to take a short break. The only problem is that I&#8217;ve got so much to catch up on :( This week will be also very busy for me, so I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll manage to post to my blog in the next days. I know I still have some blog homework to do, but I&#8217;m afraid it will have to wait for at least another week&#8230; Until then you can take a look at some photos from <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/ialja/sets/72157600275805854/">my vacation on Flickr</a>.<br /><div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/517391456/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/208/517391456_77b64b70f6_m.jpg" alt="Camel riding" height="180" width="240" /></a></div>Yeah, I know, I am quite hopeless: one of the first things I did upon my return was to upload some photos to Flickr. Yup, it&#8217;s good to be back! :)  So&#8230; stay tuned ;)<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/05/back-from-offline-week.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/05/back-from-offline-week.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

Today is a good day! We finally managed to open all content of the site <a href="http://www.moodle.si/" target="_blank">Moodle.si</a> to the public! Moodle.si is an attempt to establish an online community of <a href="http://www.moodle.org/" target="_blank">Moodle</a> users in Slovenia, so anybody from Slovenia that is reading this post and is a Moodle user is invited to join the community ;) (By the way - the site is exclusively in Slovenian language, so if you&#8217;re looking for a Moodle community in English I suggest the official <a href="http://www.moodle.org/" target="_blank">Moodle site</a>.)<br /><br />And what can be found on the site? So far we created a database activity where users can add info about their <a href="http://www.moodle.si/moodle/mod/data/view.php?id=1" target="_blank">Moodle sites</a> and a database activity where users can post their <a href="http://www.moodle.si/moodle/mod/data/view.php?id=2" target="_blank">favorite teaching/learning links</a>. We also opened a <a href="http://www.moodle.si/moodle/mod/forum/view.php?id=4" target="_blank">general discussion forum</a> and prepared a course for teacher/tutor discussions that is available to registered users. In this course we created Wiki-based instructions for teachers on how to use Moodle (version 1.6.2) that users can freely edit, and opened forums that focus on teaching with Moodle. (If you don&#8217;t speak Slovenian and would like to know more about our content, feel free to contact me.)<br /><br />Today we also sent out invitations to Moodle users that are <a href="http://moodle.org/sites/index.php?country=SI" target="_blank">listed on the Moodle site</a> and now we are anxious to receive feedback from the first users that will be joining the community. I really hope people will like and accept this idea and that the site will become a place where we&#8217;ll share ideas, experiences, and construct new knowledge :)<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/12/moodlesi-at-last.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/12/moodlesi-at-last.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-learning" target="_blank">M-learning</a> (short for mobile learning) is another form of learning I&#8217;m really interested in. As a matter of fact, I&#8217;ve been a real fan of mobile phones for a few years now - which is funny because when they first became popular I didn&#8217;t want to have one for quite some time (that was because I actually don&#8217;t like having phone conversations much). I think my love affair with mobile phones was born when they started adding extra features like e-mail reading applications that suddenly made me feel like I can connect to the Internet! And nowadays we have even better access to the Internet and many other features that don&#8217;t have much in common with telephony. <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.belgiquemobile.be/news/images/SonyEricsson/Z610-1.jpg"><img style="margin: 5pt 5px 0px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 140px; height: 142px;" src="http://www.belgiquemobile.be/news/images/SonyEricsson/Z610-1.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>For example, I recently got a new mobile phone (<a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/spg.jsp?cc=gb&lc=en&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;ver=4000&template=pip1&amp;zone=pp&pid=10527" target="_blank">Sony Ericsson Z610i</a>) and I&#8217;m just amazed at what this small beauty can do - the web browser can pick up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_%28file_format%29" target="_blank">RSS</a> feeds (that&#8217;s something even Internet Explorer didn&#8217;t do until recently!), it has a special RSS reader, the memory card can be upgraded upto 1GB, the phone connects with computers through USB and can charge its battery this way and even work as an USB storage key, it supports java applications, video calls, direct picture blogging (to Blogger), quite comfortable browsing speeds in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umts" target="_blank">UMTS</a> network, and I can use it to listen to podcasts! With these advanced features that make mobile phones much more than just phones - they are now slowly transforming into small portable computers - I see a lot of learning possibilities both for individuals and for educational institutions.<br /><br />A practical example - when I was an online tutor last year, there were days when  it was not possible for me to get to a computer and so I simply used my mobile phone to log in to our virtual classroom, read new posts and reply to the most urgent ones. Surely, doing that on a mobile phone takes a bit more time, but when you&#8217;re waiting for an appointment or traveling on a train you are actually happy to have something to pass time with :) The greatest problem I see is the fact that virtual classrooms are made for big desktop screens and working with them on tiny mobile screens can be a bit frustrating. However, I think that this problem could be solved in a number of ways - maybe by providing a mobile friendly version with less graphics or even by having a java application that just collects new content (like the <a href="http://www.google.com/press/pressrel/mail_mobileclient.html" target="_blank">Gmail mobile java client</a> - I just installed it today and it looks great!) and perhaps even saves new content on the phone so that it is available when the network signal is low or in a foreign country where the connection costs are too high. Nowadays the technology enables many things and I really hope that LMS providers will start thinking about mobile devices as well. After all, why shouldn&#8217;t we have a &#8220;large screen&#8221; and a &#8220;small screen&#8221; version of the same system?<br /><br />But of course - I think mobile phones can be much more than just a supplement to web learning. I think that the specifics of mobile phones could be used to connect and interact with other people and the environment  in new ways - especially by using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Location-based_service" target="_blank">location based services</a>. And that&#8217;s something I&#8217;m patiently waiting for mobile providers to develop. Much of the technology is already at hand - we just need great ideas to transform existing technology in services that connect people and allow new forms of interactions and knowledge construction.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(Footnote: For anyone looking for more resources on m-learning - </span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://mlearning.edublogs.org/" target="_blank">here</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">&#8217;s an interesting blog about mobile learning that I found today during my morning news reading routine :) )</span><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/12/m-learning.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/12/m-learning.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Another <a href="http://www.educause.edu/" target="_blank">EDUCAUSE</a> article that caught my attention lately is <span style="font-weight: bold;">Scholarly Reputations: </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Who’s Got Buzz?</span> (view the <a href="http://www.educause.edu/apps/er/erm06/erm0666.asp" target="_blank">HTML</a> or <a href="http://www.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ERM0666.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a> version) by <a href="http://www.educause.edu/PeerDirectory/750?ID=23074" target="_blank">Paul Kobulnicky</a> that tries to remind scholars about the importance of being on the first <a href="http://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a> screen when searched for and also the importance and value of having your work available and open online. Of course, the author underlines that having your work published in leading journals in the field is still important, but it doesn&#8217;t suffice in the age of Web 2.0.<br /><br />And here I must agree with Kobulnicky - we got used to rely heavily on Google when doing research and I must  admit that when I read an interesting article from somebody I usually Google that person to see what else he/she has published and if I can read more from the author. And the best thing that can happen is to see the person&#8217;s website or blog among the top 10 Google search results. If that doesn&#8217;t happen I usually forget the author pretty soon, but if I do find an interesting site/blog through Google I usually bookmark it because I want to keep an eye on the author&#8217;s work and research.<br /><br />And this was also one of the reasons for starting this blog. My blog enables me to share ideas, opinions, research results etc. with anyone who might be interested in my work or just random people trying to learn more about the topics I write about. When I started my blog I got some concerned views about publicly sharing my work - and usually the concerns involved the fear of having somebody &#8220;steal&#8221; my ideas. However, I think that people that are interested in stealing ideas and have nothing original to say, can steal from books or journals as well. The Internet can make stealing a bit easier, but it also makes  tracing original sources much easier (just ask our students that copy paste from the Internet without quoting - it doesn&#8217;t take much to figure out where the parts came from).<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RXQZIE8abeI/AAAAAAAAAAM/GXYQqSG9RdM/s1600-h/google-alja-sulcic.png"><img style="margin: 0pt 10pt 0px 0px; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 142px; height: 95px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RXQZIE8abeI/AAAAAAAAAAM/GXYQqSG9RdM/s320/google-alja-sulcic.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5004652712472243682" border="0" /></a>So all in all I think the benefits of public sharing are much greater than possible threats. And I can happily say that a Google search of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Alja+Sulcic" target="_blank">my name</a> has my blog on the first results page. And to that I can only say: mission Google accomplished! But of course the work isn&#8217;t done here, it is in fact just starting: a web presence without content does one no good, so I have to work on providing quality content for the loyal (or random) readers of my blog :) and in such a way add my humble contribution to the vast Internet library of knowledge.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/12/to-be-on-google-or-not-to-be.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/12/to-be-on-google-or-not-to-be.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
On <a href="http://www.educause.edu/" target="_blank">EDUCAUSE</a> I came across an interesting article by <a href="http://www.educause.edu/PeerDirectory/750?ID=73433" target="_blank">Ken A. Graetz</a> with the title <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Psychology of Learning Environments</span> (view the <a href="http://www.educause.edu/apps/er/erm06/erm0663.asp" target="_blank">HTML</a> or <a href="http://www.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ERM0663.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a> version) in which he describes some interesting ideas about how to make traditional classroom more collaborative, engaging and even enchanting for students.<br /><br />Although educational institutes don&#8217;t always have the flexibility to reorganize classroom and teaching methods, I think that there is always something we can do to make learning environments a bit more student and learning friendly. Speaking from my experience as a student, I think there are few that things more frustrating than obligatory lectures during which teachers have monologues and they think they are making lectures interactive by using bulleted power point presentations crammed with text. And not surprisingly, I rarely seemed to remember the general idea behind the lecture (even though I had no high or low tech gadgets to distract me). But on the other hand I had no problems with attending lectures that were well presented and after the lectures I often went online to learn more about bits that were particularly interesting and for this lectures I can really say that I learned a lot.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger2/5516/4465/1600/142524/learning-effic.png"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger2/5516/4465/320/395417/learning-effic.png" alt="" border="0" /></a>So, once again I think that our key question as educators should be: &#8220;How can we make learners want to learn this?&#8221;. If we find ways to engage students learning can be efficient and fun in both traditional and virtual classroom - and the psychology of learning environments can also be a factor in making learning work, but it can&#8217;t be the only one. If I make reference to the example of an enchanting classroom that was used in the classroom: the Divination classroom surely managed to capture Harry Potter&#8217;s attention on the first day, but poor teaching methods made him drop out of the class later on ;) So, I think that we should definitely try to enchant students with comfortable learning environments and also with relevant content that will be delivered in such a way that it will motivate students - learning is after a challenging and valuable process when we want it and when we feel comfortable in doing it!<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/12/psychology-of-learning-environments.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/12/psychology-of-learning-environments.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Another interesting article I read on <a href="http://www.educause.edu/" target="_blank">EDUCAUSE</a> today was <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Myth about No Significant Difference</span>  (view the <a href="http://www.educause.edu/apps/er/erm06/erm0667.asp" target="_blank">HTML</a> or <a href="http://www.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/erm0667.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a> version) by <a href="http://www.educause.edu/PeerDirectory/750?ID=28818" target="_blank">Diana G. Oblinger</a> and <a href="http://www.educause.edu/PeerDirectory/750?ID=05619" target="_blank">Brian L. Hawkins</a>. The authors argue with the supposed no significant difference (for more info about this phenomena check out the <a href="http://www.nosignificantdifference.org/" target="_blank">official website</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22no+significant+difference%22" target="_blank">Google the term</a>) that the introduction of technology brings to education by posing the question &#8220;Difference in what?&#8221; and presenting more detailed questions that should be asked when evaluating and planning the introduction of ICT in education.<br /><br />I agree with the ideas presented in the article. Judging from our own research and even personal experiences I think that technology by itself can&#8217;t make learning better or even worse. Technology is just a tool that must be used wisely and our research shows that human support is a more important factor for successful learning than the technology that we use. From my experience as an online tutor I can say that students simply expect the technology to be simple and reliable, because they don&#8217;t want to waste time on figuring out how something works, but their judgment on the quality of e-learning is based on how they interact with other students and faculty staff. Our students really appreciated and praised the constant tutor support - the fact that they could always ask for additional explanations or information and the fact that they were getting constant feedback on their work and progress.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger2/5516/4465/1600/316285/happy-ict.png"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger2/5516/4465/320/26292/happy-ict.png" alt="" border="0" /></a>Also, I think that the possibilities for interaction and collaboration are what make technology so appealing. Of course it&#8217;s great to use a word processors as they make writing so easy and fast (well, most of the times - at least up to the point when they *cough* Microsoft Word *cough* start having their own weird moods :-] ), but what is really making ICT increasingly popular and appealing is the chance to connect to other users. We don&#8217;t buy a computer because we want to <span style="font-style: italic;">have</span> a computer, but because we want to <span style="font-style: italic;">do something</span> with it - and in most of the cases &#8220;doing something&#8221; involves connecting with other people - either by chatting with friends, accessing various opinions, creative expressions, hear news about people around the world, play an online game or  do research and learn new things. Whenever my Internet connection is down I really feel that my computer has become less useful, less interesting.<br /><br />To wrap things up - in my opinion (and experiences) technology doesn&#8217;t in fact make a significant difference if it isn&#8217;t used for a good purpose and if it tries to replace or remove human interactions. If people use technology for the right tasks and to improve interaction and collaboration with each other, I believe that it can make a difference - in most of the cases a positive one!<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/12/no-significant-difference-in-what.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/12/no-significant-difference-in-what.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
These days I&#8217;m a bit less active on my blog because I&#8217;m struggling with the statistic analysis of the surveys and data about tutor support for the E-business course that is delivered through a virtual classroom (for more info on the course check one of <a href="/do-e-business-students-need-to-learn.html">my previous posts</a>). And so it is only fair to share some findings that already surfaced during the analysis. I actually found out that tutor&#8217;s activity (i. e. number of post) has significant positive effects on how students grade their tutor. However, the number of students&#8217; posts shows no correlation with the number of posts from the online tutor. In other words - students have to write a certain number of posts to complete the task anyway and the number of posts by the tutor serves mainly to increase the satisfaction with the tutor&#8217;s work. What the tutor usually does in his/her posts is to answer questions, lead students in the right direction and that is why it is not surprising that students are more satisfied with e-learning in general and are able to focus on learning and not on their doubts and technical problems. Also, the frequency with which the tutor checks in the virtual classroom positively affects the grades students assign to their tutor. Of course, these results are mainly based on quantitative analysis and don&#8217;t say much about the quality of post, but I think they represent a good starting point for further development of tutor support (and also future training courses for online tutors).<br /><br />So, that&#8217;s just a brief update on my research work and findings. If you&#8217;ve got similar experiences to share or questions about my research feel free to leave a note :)<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/online-tutors-and-student-satisfaction.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/online-tutors-and-student-satisfaction.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Today I came across an interesting post in the <a href="http://www.speedofcreativity.org/" target="_blank">Moving at the Speed of Creativity</a> blog in which there&#8217;s a short description of the flow experience as described by the psychologist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi" target="_blank">Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</a>. For a definition of the flow experience I suggest reading the post <a href="http://www.speedofcreativity.org/2006/11/23/flow-curiosity-and-engaging-education/" target="_blank">Flow, curiosity, and engaging education</a> or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29" target="_blank">Wikipedia article</a>.<br /><br />The post and ideas that are presented caught my attention because I think that educators should be aware of this phenomena and consider it when preparing activities for our students. This is especially important when we&#8217;re trying to present e-learning to students that have low ICT skills. In this case the chosen online learning environment and especially the human support should be simple and available enough to represent a manageable challenge for students - but on the other hand we should consider students that are &#8220;digitally native&#8221; and give them enough challenges to avoid boredom. And of course - here comes the tricky part. How can we find an equilibrium and satisfy all groups of students?<br /><br />Perhaps one way to solve this problem could be to motivate students with higher skills to help students with lower skills - in this way experienced users get some challenges while newbies get the needed support and the ability to improve their &#8220;digital&#8221; skills and begin the &#8220;digital immigration&#8221; process. Also, in this way students start learning how to cooperate online, start building a positive online community, and construct knowledge and group identity. And let&#8217;s not forget that this method could also be used by faculty staff - teacher and tutors after all have different attitudes and skills towards e-learning and I think that building an online support community within an organization can strengthen relationship between teachers/tutors, improve skills and attitudes toward ICT, and consequently contribute to a more effective delivery of e-learning courses. I certainly think we should be giving this idea a try in our practical work and engage more people in the flow where they&#8217;ll be receptive and positive about learning new things and skills!<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/getting-into-flow.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/getting-into-flow.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

Podcasting - yes, another of the new e-learning buzz words. Another buzz word I think that we should be researching and trying to find out how it could be useful to our students.<br /><br />And just what are these podcasts everybody is talking about? Basically, podcasts are audio files (usually mp3) that are described by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_feed" target="_blank">web feed</a> (using RSS or Atom standards) and that can be downloaded and played on personal computers or portable media devices. (Read about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcasts" target="_blank">podcasts on Wikipedia</a>)<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger2/5516/4465/1600/172415/podcast.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger2/5516/4465/400/310096/podcast.png" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />The benefit of having a web feed describing audio files is that applications that understand web feed can alert us when a new audio file is added to a certain channel and even automatically download this file to our computers. Which means that you don&#8217;t have to manually check for updates on your favorite podcast channels, but you can let your favorite program do the checking and downloading for you. Pretty cool, right?<br /><br />Now, podcast channels can of course be also used in education. You can record lectures, additional instructions, information or feedback and students can download this content and listen to it at home or on the road using their iPods, Zunes, mobile phones or any other portable device. In this way they can learn whenever they want and at a chosen pace. For example - I always wished I could fast forward parts of the lectures that were already known to me and focus more on parts that were new or particularly interesting to me. Of course that can&#8217;t be done during traditional lectures, because there is a whole class of students with different needs, knowledge and interests the lecturer must accommodate to. But learning with podcasts is different. You can choose the appropriate time for learning and use the recording of a lecture in any way you want - you can for example review only parts of the lecture that you did not fully understand.<br /><br />And it is because of the learning flexibility that podcasts offer that I think we should try out this form of delivery and see how students react to it. I also think it&#8217;s great that we can use our existing e-classroom for this purpose, as there is a simple podcasting module available for our LMS <a href="http://www.moodle.org/" target="_blank">Moodle</a> (the <a href="http://moodle.org/mod/data/view.php?d=13&rid=378" target="_blank">Ipodcast module</a>).<br /><br />So, I hope we&#8217;ll be able to test podcasting at our faculty and if and when we do so, I&#8217;ll surely be posting observations and results on this blog. For now here&#8217;s a list of articles about podcasts, the process of making podcasts and the uses of podcasting in education that I&#8217;ve used for making a short paper about podcasting for our teachers:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://recap.ltd.uk/articles/podguide.html" target="_blank">Exploiting the educational potential of podcasting</a></li><li><a href="http://radio.about.com/od/podcastin1/a/aa030805a.htm" target="_blank">How to Create Your Own Podcast - A Step-by-Step Tutorial</a></li><li><a href="http://www.podcastingnews.com/articles/How-to-Podcast.html" target="_blank">Make Your First Podcast</a></li><li><a href="http://www.learninginhand.com/podcasting/index.html" target="_blank">Podcasting in Education</a></li><li><a href="http://www.learningcircuits.org/2005/jun2005/0506_trends" target="_blank">Trend: Podcasting in Academic and Corporate Learning </a></li></ul><br /><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(By the way: if you want a taste of podcasts I suggest listening to the podcast channel </span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">60-Second Science</span><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);"> that offers short daily bits of interesting science.

<a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/" target="_blank">Lost</a> is a popular <a href="http://www.abc.com/" target="_blank">ABC</a> TV show with a pretty simple plot: a plane crashes on a remote island and the plain survivors get stranded on the island, which (as they soon find out) is modestly said a bit odd with a few shy monsters, polar bears, whispers, the Others and what not. Through the show we try to learn more about the island and the lives of the survivors in a really interesting way. The show itself is quite interesting, but what has really made it stand out was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Experience" target="_blank">Lost Experience</a> that kept fans busy during the summer break.<br /><br />The Lost Experience provided fans with new mysteries and some explanations in different forms and through different channels. Fans were hunting for clues through websites, ads, voice mail and even a novel, and had to use various skills to make sense of the clues. The creators of the game also managed to include very clever ways of advertising for different products (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Experience" target="_blank">the Wikipedia article</a>).<br /><br />Ok, ok - I&#8217;m a Lost fan and all this is of course very interesting to me, but why am I writing about the Lost Experience on this e-learning blog? Well, it is my opinion that educators could learn a thing or two from this interactive game and perhaps use it to our advantage in our classes. Just imagine a class that would be as interesting as the show and that would provide additional information (and training) through a series of interactive web (or mobile) tools. Just imagine your students getting so fanatic about searching for new clues and having to use different skills to access them. That would be pretty cool, right?<br /><br />I already wrote about a similar form of learning in <a href="/2006/11/lets-go-on-webquest.html">my post about WebQuests</a>, and the Lost Experience was a sort of WebQuest, but I think such quests (not just with the web prefix, but also including libraries, mobile technologies, traditional media etc.) should also be taken a step further by lectures (not necessarily exclusively face-to-face) that would interest students in the subject perhaps with a bit of mystery and stories - why shouldn&#8217;t we borrow some tricks from the most interesting TV shows? If I think back to my education I see too many boring hours of facts (not always up-to-date), interesting topics killed by poor delivery, too little space for creativity and not enough of collaboration. And collaboration is also something very important that made the Lost Experience not just interesting but also possible. The Lost Experience would be a really boring and difficult experience to follow without the collaboration among players. The players of this games worked together to find clues, understand their meaning and then discuss it. One week you could be the first to find and decipher a clue and share it with others, the next week you perhaps got clues from other players.<br /><br />So, how can we put all this cool stuff into practice? Well, first of we could and perhaps should encourage students more to look beyond the typical LMS. Of course it&#8217;s great to have all the course materials and assignments in one place, but students should be encouraged to look for other sources of information and other tools. The course material should be written in a more interesting way, it should challenge students to verify information, to look for alternative explanations. And course activities should encourage students to use different tools and skills. The LMS should perhaps mainly be a centralized place to share learning experiences, discuss new findings, argue about important questions etc.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/5516/4465/1600/learning-experience.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/5516/4465/400/learning-experience.png" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />I really think that we can learn a lot from the observation of things that manage to intrigue people. And I believe that learning and education should be intriguing for students. Now we have lots of tools that can help us to make that happen; the only limit is our own imagination and creativity. And I think the best way to get new ideas is to find forms of learning that people start on their own and that they find fun and rewarding. I think that instead of asking ourselves <span style="font-style: italic;">How can we teach this?</span> we should be asking the question <span style="font-style: italic;">How can we make the learners <span style="font-weight: bold;">want</span> to learn this?</span><br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(If you want to learn more about Lost or the Lost Experience I suggesting the </span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://www.lostpedia.com/" target="_blank">Lostpedia</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">. Yes, the show even has its own huge Wiki!)</span><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/what-can-we-learn-from-lost-experience.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/what-can-we-learn-from-lost-experience.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
I am young enough to qualify as a member of the <a href="http://www.marcprensky.com/writing/Prensky%20-%20Digital%20Natives,%20Digital%20Immigrants%20-%20Part1.pdf" target="_blank">Digital Natives</a>, and although I try to keep up-to-date with all new technologies, I&#8217;ve noticed that in some aspects of computer usage I still stick with my old thought patterns that can be dated to as back as the times of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1" target="_blank">Windows 3.1</a> (when I was learning to use computers). Of course, that&#8217;s something we always do to simplify our lives: when you find something that works you keep it, and rarely stop to reconsider its efficiency after some time. And this thought has led me to consider my digital flexibility or in other words try to answer this question: <span style="font-style: italic;">How much do my thought patterns that are related to computer usage change as a consequence of developments in the software I use?</span><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/5516/4465/1600/address-book.png"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 238px; height: 181px;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/5516/4465/320/address-book.png" alt="" border="0" /></a>This year I was finally introduced to the world of Macs and <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger/" target="_blank">Mac OS X (Tiger)</a>. After a few months of heavy daily usage I can now say that I got used to the UI pretty fast, learned new keyboard shortcuts, but I can still catch myself using certain persistent Windows 3.1 methods that aren&#8217;t really adding to my work efficiency. You want a practical example? (If not, move to the last paragraph ;) ) Here it is: I wanted to modify a contact in my address book - and what did I do? I opened Address Book and started looking for the contact in the list. It was only after a few seconds of intense reading through the list of names that I said to myself: why don&#8217;t I use the search box? And so I did - I typed the first few letters of the name I was searching for and ta-da! the contact is ready to edit. Ah, so simple.<br /><span class="on" style="display: block;" id="formatbar_CreateLink" title="Link" onmouseover="ButtonHoverOn(this);" onmouseout="ButtonHoverOff(this);" onmouseup="" onmousedown="CheckFormatting(event);FormatbarButton('richeditorframe', this, 8);ButtonMouseDown(this);"></span><br />Another example? One of my favorite Windows applications was the Windows Explorer. Why? Well, because it allows you to organize your hard drives, organize files in folders and sub folders and then have a nice hierarchical view of all folders. Yes, pretty. And I am still very strict about keeping and organizing files in folders - whenever I have more than a few files on a certain subject I make a new folder. Really tidy.<br /><br />So, now I&#8217;m on Mac OS X and here I of course use the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/finder/" target="_blank">Finder</a> and guess what&#8217;s my favorite view option? Columns of course, so that I can see the structure of folders on my disk. But why is that necessary? What is wrong with the icons view? And an even more important question: Why don&#8217;t I use <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/spotlight/" target="_blank">Spotlight</a> to access folders? After all it&#8217;s much easier - Command + Space, type in a few letters and you get all related files, folders, calendar events etc. I already use Spotlight to access programs, so why can&#8217;t I do the same with files and folders? I don&#8217;t know - maybe seeing files so nicely organized in folders gives me a sense of physical presence.<br /><br />But then - why don&#8217;t we organize our files like mails in <a href="http://www.gmail.com/" target="_blank">GMail</a>? There you have all messages in one place (the Inbox), and you can use Labels to sort them in categories (each item can have one or more labels) and then it&#8217;s so easy to see the elements in a certain category and if you want to search for something specific just use the search box! And the same principle also applies to blogs on <a href="http://www.blogger.com/" target="_blank">Blogger</a>. And it&#8217;s a principle I really love to use - but why don&#8217;t I use some to manage my files? One thing that drives me crazy is saving and organizing different articles - right now I have an unknown number of folders with the title &#8220;Articles&#8221; and they are located in different folders for different projects. So, why don&#8217;t I put all the interesting articles in one folder and use Spotlight comments to define the topic or/and the project they relate to?<br /><br />And it was then that I realized that although I catch up with new inventions relatively fast, I am still attached to some old thought patterns. For this reason I made a resolution: I will try to train myself to be digitally more flexible. I must not stop at admiring new ways of digital interaction, but I must move forward and try to get used to the new way of interaction and if it proves to be efficient, I must adopt it. So my first step will be no more columns view, let&#8217;s try to take advantage of the Spotlight live search technology! :)<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/5516/4465/1600/old-new.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 298px; height: 170px;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/5516/4465/320/old-new.png" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />Ok, ok, why is all this important for anyone else but me? Because if we want to keep up with new developments we have to try to really understand new ideas and concepts. Of course - I&#8217;m not saying we should all start doing things in a new way as soon as the new way is shown - but we could at least try to give the new way a try. And from time to time we can evaluate our digital flexibility. Trying to adapt to new thought patters can after all be a great mental exercise, and for those of us that are trying to bring technology closer to new generations it is almost necessary to understand how new generations are thinking. My younger brother is surely not bothered about folder structures as much as I am, and is certainly more comfortable about dragging and dropping things around the place (that&#8217;s something I am still not completely comfortable with ;) ). And with the development of new technologies and ways of interaction these differences will probably increase. Now, there&#8217;s no reason to fear the change - instead we should keep an eye on it and from time to time ask ourselves questions like: <span style="font-style: italic;">How digitally flexible am I?</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">Can I do this task in a different way?</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">How are children using computers - can we learn something from them?</span> And at last but not least - we should be prepared to share our experience with others and be prepared to learn from each other.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/digital-flexibility.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/digital-flexibility.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

So far I haven&#8217;t been posting as much about <a href="http://www.moodle.org/" target="_blank">Moodle</a> as I intended to, so to make up for that I&#8217;d like to post some resources for using Moodle (for teachers):<br /><ul><li><a href="http://docs.moodle.org/" target="_blank">Moodle Docs</a> - the official Moodle documentation about using, maintaining and developing Moodle. </li><li><a href="http://moodle.tokem.fi/mod/book/view.php?id=5116" target="_blank">Moodle: Teacher&#8217;s Manual 1.5.4</a> - a nice guide book from Finland.</li><li><a href="http://learn.humboldt.edu/course/view.php?id=3765" target="_blank">The HSU Faculty Guide to Moodle-Fall 2006</a> - in form of a Moodle course, also includes video presentations.</li><li><a href="http://k12online.wm.edu/moodle01/moodle.html" target="_blank">Moodling Around: A Virtual Tour </a>- a couple of interesting screencasts from Karen Work Richardson.</li></ul>These resources were really useful to me when I helping to rewrite the new Moodle manual for teachers of our faculty.

<a href="http://www.forbes.com/" target="_blank">Forbes.com</a> reports that there are <a href="http://www.forbes.com/business/services/feeds/ap/2006/11/09/ap3158413.html" target="_blank">More College Students Taking Web Courses</a>. Hurray! Of course, such articles can be very useful to support arguments about how cool e-learning is, but I think that they can also be a bit misleading. Why? Well, because in a way they lead to the conclusion that quantity equals quality. The article makes me think more about those 38 percent of &#8220;chief academic officers&#8221; included in the reported survey that <span style="font-weight: bold;">don&#8217;t</span> think that students learned as well or better from online courses (compared to face-to-face courses) and that perhaps think that the obstacles for online learning are just too big. This isn&#8217;t such a small percentage - are we just going to ignore this number?<br /><br />Of course, the report brings good news that the interest in online learning is growing, but with more students enrolled in online courses we also face the problem of having more demanding students. Students are expecting the online learning experience to be as good or even better than their previous face-to-face learning experiences. And if we want this to happen, we can&#8217;t just let students in an online classroom and tell them to learn!<br /><br />My personal experience shows that online students need quite some attention and support to deal with online learning, and that is why I think our efforts should be focused on developing ways and strategies for providing better online learning support. I believe that providing better support for students will also lead to even more positive quantitative statistical data and will help to kick most of the online learning barriers away. But for this to happen we must rethink our educational paradigm and start proving quality tutoring for online students. Among my favorite articles on this subject are <a href="http://www.marcprensky.com/" target="_blank">Mark Prensky</a>&#8217;s <a href="http://www.marcprensky.com/writing/Prensky%20-%20e-Nough%20-%20OTH%2011-1%20March%202003.pdf" target="_blank">E-nough!</a> and Alfred Bork&#8217;s <a href="http://www.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ERM0010.pdf" target="_blank">Teaching and Learning are Often Mentioned Together</a>.<br /><br />So, I really hope that more articles and reports will be focusing on how to improve support for online students. And when we learn more about that and put it to work in practice, then perhaps it will be the right time to be truly proud of an increasing number of enrollments in online courses. Let&#8217;s not forget that we are here for the students and that the key factor for our success is their satisfaction with online courses and not the number of students that give online courses a try (and  perhaps drop out soon afterwards because of poor course delivery)!<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/more-college-students-taking-web.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/more-college-students-taking-web.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Maybe a bit off topic (though this being my personal blog I can never really be off topic ;) ) - I stumbled upon a really interesting article on <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/" target="_blank">NewScientist.com</a> about inner time perception: <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18925371.700" target="_blank">Teach your brain to stretch time</a>. The article presents some really interesting findings and theories about how our brains deal with time and why time flies by or seems to stand still on different occasions.<br /><br />This reminds me of a great BBC series that I recently saw - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Supernatural/dp/B000FZDH1O" target="_blank">Supernatural</a>. The series features the episode <span style="font-weight: bold;">Time Warp</span> in which differences in time perception among animals are presented. Definitely a series I recommend to see!<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/about-time-perception.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/about-time-perception.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

So far I haven&#8217;t been posting as much about <a href="http://www.moodle.org/" target="_blank">Moodle</a> as I intended to, so to make up for that I&#8217;d like to post some resources for using Moodle (for teachers):<br /><ul><li><a href="http://docs.moodle.org/" target="_blank">Moodle Docs</a> - the official Moodle documentation about using, maintaining and developing Moodle. </li><li><a href="http://moodle.tokem.fi/mod/book/view.php?id=5116" target="_blank">Moodle: Teacher&#8217;s Manual 1.5.4</a> - a nice guide book from Finland.</li><li><a href="http://learn.humboldt.edu/course/view.php?id=3765" target="_blank">The HSU Faculty Guide to Moodle-Fall 2006</a> - in form of a Moodle course, also includes video presentations.</li><li><a href="http://k12online.wm.edu/moodle01/moodle.html" target="_blank">Moodling Around: A Virtual Tour </a>- a couple of interesting screencasts from Karen Work Richardson.</li></ul>These resources were really useful to me when I helping to rewrite the new Moodle manual for teachers of our faculty.

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<a href="http://www.forbes.com/" target="_blank">Forbes.com</a> reports that there are <a href="http://www.forbes.com/business/services/feeds/ap/2006/11/09/ap3158413.html" target="_blank">More College Students Taking Web Courses</a>. Hurray! Of course, such articles can be very useful to support arguments about how cool e-learning is, but I think that they can also be a bit misleading. Why? Well, because in a way they lead to the conclusion that quantity equals quality. The article makes me think more about those 38 percent of &#8220;chief academic officers&#8221; included in the reported survey that <span style="font-weight: bold;">don&#8217;t</span> think that students learned as well or better from online courses (compared to face-to-face courses) and that perhaps think that the obstacles for online learning are just too big. This isn&#8217;t such a small percentage - are we just going to ignore this number?<br /><br />Of course, the report brings good news that the interest in online learning is growing, but with more students enrolled in online courses we also face the problem of having more demanding students. Students are expecting the online learning experience to be as good or even better than their previous face-to-face learning experiences. And if we want this to happen, we can&#8217;t just let students in an online classroom and tell them to learn!<br /><br />My personal experience shows that online students need quite some attention and support to deal with online learning, and that is why I think our efforts should be focused on developing ways and strategies for providing better online learning support. I believe that providing better support for students will also lead to even more positive quantitative statistical data and will help to kick most of the online learning barriers away. But for this to happen we must rethink our educational paradigm and start proving quality tutoring for online students. Among my favorite articles on this subject are <a href="http://www.marcprensky.com/" target="_blank">Mark Prensky</a>&#8217;s <a href="http://www.marcprensky.com/writing/Prensky%20-%20e-Nough%20-%20OTH%2011-1%20March%202003.pdf" target="_blank">E-nough!</a> and Alfred Bork&#8217;s <a href="http://www.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ERM0010.pdf" target="_blank">Teaching and Learning are Often Mentioned Together</a>.<br /><br />So, I really hope that more articles and reports will be focusing on how to improve support for online students. And when we learn more about that and put it to work in practice, then perhaps it will be the right time to be truly proud of an increasing number of enrollments in online courses. Let&#8217;s not forget that we are here for the students and that the key factor for our success is their satisfaction with online courses and not the number of students that give online courses a try (and  perhaps drop out soon afterwards because of poor course delivery)!<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/more-college-students-taking-web.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/more-college-students-taking-web.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

Maybe a bit off topic (though this being my personal blog I can never really be off topic ;) ) - I stumbled upon a really interesting article on <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/" target="_blank">NewScientist.com</a> about inner time perception: <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18925371.700" target="_blank">Teach your brain to stretch time</a>. The article presents some really interesting findings and theories about how our brains deal with time and why time flies by or seems to stand still on different occasions.<br /><br />This reminds me of a great BBC series that I recently saw - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Supernatural/dp/B000FZDH1O" target="_blank">Supernatural</a>. The series features the episode <span style="font-weight: bold;">Time Warp</span> in which differences in time perception among animals are presented. Definitely a series I recommend to see!<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/about-time-perception.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/about-time-perception.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html" target="_blank">Web 2.0</a> has become a popular buzz word and of course you can&#8217;t have Web 2.0 with ordinary e-learning - so now it&#8217;s time for E-learning 2.0!

But I think that reading <a href="http://www.elearnmag.org/subpage.cfm?section=articles&article=29-1" target="_blank">this article</a> about E-learning 2.0 by <a href="http://www.downes.ca/" target="_blank">Stephen Downes</a> can help you to understand the meaning and practical application of these buzz words.<br /><br />For me E-learning 2.0 represents a real opportunity to finally shift the focus from the technology to the users and to make e-learning really a <span style="font-weight: bold;">learning</span> experience and not just a different form of study material delivery. Education does in my opinion need to move with the technology developments. Not only because we need to develop <a href="http://www.ncrel.org/engauge/skills/engauge21st.pdf" target="_blank">appropriate 21st century skills </a>to keep with up new technologies, but also because we need to learn how to involve <a href="http://www.marcprensky.com/writing/Prensky%20-%20Digital%20Natives,%20Digital%20Immigrants%20-%20Part1.pdf" target="_blank">digital native</a> generations in learning.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/what-is-e-learning-20.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/what-is-e-learning-20.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

Huh? Can I hear you asking what is a WebQuest? Here are some formal answers:<br /><ul><li>for the impatient: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webquest" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></li><li>for those that have a bit more time to spend and a bit more curiosity to feed here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.tommarch.com/ozblog/" target="_blank">Tom March</a>&#8217;s article <a href="http://bestwebquests.com/what_webquests_are.asp" target="_blank">What WebQuests Are (Really)</a>.</li></ul><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/5516/4465/1600/work.png"><img style="margin: 10pt 10pt 0px 0px; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/5516/4465/200/work.png" alt="" border="0" /></a>Now that we are familiar with the theory we can see that WebQuests promote an active way of learning through the transformation of various web resources and prior knowledge to a learning outcome that students relate to. WebQuests can use different types of tasks (for a classification of WebQuest tasks see <a href="http://webquest.sdsu.edu/taskonomy.html" target="_blank">A Taxonomy of Tasks</a>) to activate students and stimulate their learning and understanding of a subject.<br /><br />And where can an educator interested in taking his/her students on a WebQuest start? You can browse sites that provide list of WebQuests in different categories (like <a href="http://bestwebquests.com/" target="_blank">BestWebQuests.com</a>) or you can make up your own WebQuest. If you want to create your own unique WebQuest I suggest the reading of <a href="http://bestwebquests.com/tips/red_flags.asp" target="_blank">The 7 Red Flags: Warning Signs when Sifting WebQuests</a> (also by Tom March) that provide some examples that can help you distinguish between real WebQuests and quests that will mostly result in training your student&#8217;s thumb and index fingers (because of the continual stroking of Command+C and Command+V keys).<br /><br />Of course, our students aren&#8217;t the only people that should be taking WebQuests. WebQuests can be a great way of learning - even for educators. If you want to give it a try I suggest following the WebQuest: <a href="http://web-and-flow.com/members/tmarch/classactportal/webquest.htm" target="_blank">Leveraging the Latest in Learning Technologies</a> (guess by who? Yes, again Tom March). Through this quest you will try to answer the main question: &#8220;What&#8217;s up with these new technologies and are they any good for learning?&#8221; and I think it can be a great exercise to get a bit more familiar with all these new technologies and to think about how they can be used in practice.<br /><br />I hope these links will encourage some new WebQuests to take place and consequently some new knowledge to be learnt :) And don&#8217;t forget to share your experience with WebQuests with others in your favorite way!<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/lets-go-on-webquest.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/lets-go-on-webquest.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

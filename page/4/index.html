This year, I&#8217;m particularly excited about attending <b><a href="http://2011.imoot.org/">iMoot2011</a></b>, the second annual web based International Moodle Moot.</p>iMoot2011 will be running from <b>30th April to 3rd May 2011</b>, 24 hours a day to accommodate different time zones. If you want to get involved as a presenter, you can <a href="http://2011.imoot.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=4">submit presentation proposals and academic papers</a>&nbsp;by February 19th, or&nbsp;<a href="http://2011.imoot.org/mod/book/view.php?id=31&amp;chapterid=9">register</a>&nbsp;as an attendee (got my early bird registration yesterday!).<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2011.imoot.org/mod/book/view.php?id=31&amp;chapterid=11" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="156" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/TUfWyoZRhwI/AAAAAAAAAq4/aab6wPjlNIk/s320/new_directions.png" width="320" /></a></div><br />The theme for iMoot2011 is <a href="http://2011.imoot.org/mod/book/view.php?id=31&amp;chapterid=11"><b>New Directions</b></a>, a fitting title considering Moodle 2.0 has finally been released at the end of last year. However, it&#8217;s good to know that Moodle&#8217;s new directions won&#8217;t be the main focus on the conference; instead, the goal of the conference will be to explore the potential of using new technologies and pedagogical ideas in an evolving online learning space, where Moodle is just a piece of the puzzle.<br /><br />You can find more info about the conference on the <a href="http://2011.imoot.org/">official iMoot2011 website</a>. I&#8217;m certainly looking forward to participating in the conference, getting new ideas and meeting new and old Moolde buddies.

Davis reminds us about how important it is to give genuine compliments to our students and colleagues every day. I certainly try to follow this advice in my day to day work. Remembering to thank people for their effort and acknowledging their success is a simple gesture that can make a big impact. After all, we all want to be good at what we&#8217;re doing and to know that what we do is meaningful, don&#8217;t we?<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">Challenge: Do Nothing for Two Minutes</span></b><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.donothingfor2minutes.com/"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/TT2CuUTc9JI/AAAAAAAAAqs/XKTRdWJDWRI/s1600/do-nothing-for-2-minutes.png" /></a></div><br /><b>Why it&#8217;s worth sharing:</b>&nbsp;It&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.donothingfor2minutes.com/">simple website</a> with a simple idea: relax and do nothing for only two minutes. Easy, no? Well, it turns out it can be quite a challenge if you&#8217;re used to constantly check your e-mails, Facebook, Twitter and what not. It&#8217;s certainly a nice idea that encourages to stop and relax, even if it is just for our couple of minutes. Perhaps we&#8217;d all felt a little bit better if we passed this simple challenge every day. (via <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/01/22/do-nothing-website/">@mashable</a>)<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">Idea: Standing desk</span></b><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ginatrapani/5357711375/" title="Standing desk by ginatrapani, on Flickr"><img alt="Standing desk" height="400" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5082/5357711375_3850019910.jpg" width="300" /></a></div><br /><b>Why it&#8217;s worth sharing:</b> Gina Trapani&#8217;s blog post <a href="http://smarterware.org/7102/how-and-why-i-switched-to-a-standing-desk">Why and How I Switched to a Standing Desk</a> provides a nice overview of the transition from a traditional &#8220;sitdown desk&#8221; to a standing desk and working on your feet. As someone, who tends to sit behind the computer desk in awkward positions all day long, I find this idea quite intriguing. I admit - I haven&#8217;t decided to make the switch yet, but at least the post reminded me that I should get up and stretch more often during the day.<br /><br /><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999;"><b>Sharable Bits</b> is a series of weekly posts that will highlight some of the most interesting bits and bytes that I stumble upon.

<a href="http://draft.blogger.com/h#" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/TS7xfggYv1I/AAAAAAAAAqY/vgXUarsDnAM/s1600/appstore_20100403.jpg" /></a><br />The web seems like somethings everyone should know how to use by now. But what about the less experienced aka the majority of users? Do they really know how to use their browsers? And understand what&#8217;s going on on their computer screens?<br /><p>I think computers are still mysterious, magic boxes for a lot of people outside the tech savvy crowd, and we need to keep looking for solutions that can change that perception. Perhaps by learning from simple, easy to use, user centered mobile devices, like the iPad.</p><br /><b>The web is a strange place for the average user</b><br /><br />As a reader (or occasional visitor) of this blog, you probably have a good basic understanding of how the web works. You&#8217;re probably familiar with the concept of a web browser and how your browser interacts with web servers to display different web locations. You know how to copy, type and check the URL of a website to make sure you&#8217;ve opened the right web page, and you&#8217;re probably reading this page in one of the many tabs open in your browser, perhaps even an RSS reader.<br /><br />But all of the above isn&#8217;t such an easy task for everyone.&nbsp;If you think the web is easy to use, I challenge you to observe the way so-called &#8220;average users&#8221; interact with it. Users, who have never received any real training, and are not really interested in understanding how the whole system works. They just want to check their e-mail, share photos on Facebook or find a store&#8217;s phone number on the web.<br /><br />I have seem that many times in the past few months (while trying to teach them how to use a pretty complex online tool), and I must say it has changes my perspective. The web just seems like a different place for the average user than it is to me or probably you.&nbsp;It&#8217;s a place where the Google search box is your starting point because you don&#8217;t know the URL of your school&#8217;s website, it&#8217;s a place where you only use one window at a time (tabs? what tabs?), it&#8217;s a place full of confusion and notifications you don&#8217;t really understand. Update? Pop-ups? RSS? Java script? Is that even English?<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://icanhascheezburger.com/2008/03/03/funny-pictures-we-dint-touch-it/"><img alt="Humorous Pictures" src="http://icanhascheezburger.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/funny-pictures-cats-computer-blue-screen-death.jpg" style="font-size: 552267px; word-spacing: 552267px;" /></a></div><br />It&#8217;s just so different from the world we, the tech crowd, live in. It&#8217;s not a world where the lack of multitasking before iOS 4 was a problem, it&#8217;s a world where no multitasking is a great feature.<br /><br /><b>Why do you make me switch windows and apps?</b><br /><br />It&#8217;s certainly something that we should all keep in mind when designing user interfaces and user experiences on the web. You think your registration process, which requires e-mail confirmation, is simple? Think again. The average user doesn&#8217;t want to switch windows and apps, and doesn&#8217;t want to read your friendly instructions about activation and other nonsense. They just want to get things done.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/TS7qHIk45oI/AAAAAAAAAqU/vHMNkHVoYso/s1600/WP7-tiles.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/TS7qHIk45oI/AAAAAAAAAqU/vHMNkHVoYso/s1600/WP7-tiles.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;"><i>Photo: </i></span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-ww/default.aspx"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;"><i>Microsoft.com</i></span></a></td></tr></tbody></table>And that is where we can learn a lot from the new generation of smartphone operating systems (thinking mainly about iOS and Windows Phone 7, I&#8217;ll leave my Android rant for another post). They make it easier for people to understand what they&#8217;ll get and where to get it. With big, easy to tap icons, and a simple, physical Home button that always gets you back to the starting line. No complicated lists of programs, no need to decide where to save your files&#8230; In many ways, the mobile OS is smarter than your desktop OS, even though the &#8220;smartness&#8221; is a result of the limits such small devices have.<br /><br /><b>Let the OS do the work and just enjoy the ride</b><br /><br />Many of the features that make current smartphones so pleasant to use, were first introduced by Apple. Of course, a lot of skeptics laughed at the lack of multitasking, physical keyboard and what not, but 4 years after the original iPhone came out, everyone is trying to make a better iPhone. Not a better smartphone per se, but a better iPhone. And even though the geeks love Android for being a more open platform, iPhone keeps setting the standard for the high-end smartphone market.<br /><br />And I think Apple is actually on the right track again with the concept of <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/lion/">Mac OS X Lion</a>, the next major upgrade to their desktop OS due to be released this summer. Lion will take a bold step at bringing features from the mobile world - the magic of iPad, as they call it - to the desktop. A unified place to download, buy and update your applications, a launchpad with big, colorful icons, and full-screen apps that take away all the distractions of your desktop.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/TS7ncrBNCuI/AAAAAAAAAqQ/r6auLqSJrGU/s1600/lion-full-screen-iphoto-app.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/TS7ncrBNCuI/AAAAAAAAAqQ/r6auLqSJrGU/s1600/lion-full-screen-iphoto-app.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;"><i>Photo: </i></span><a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/lion/"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;"><i>Apple.com</i></span></a></td></tr></tbody></table>I can see all this being a big hit with the average users (time to switch grandpa to Mac OS X!). An app for Facebook, an app for your e-mail, an app for your workspace (which lives in the cloud, but you don&#8217;t really know or care about it), and an app for Google, so you can find everything else. And you don&#8217;t have to worry about whether apps are closed or open and about saving your work. You want to do something else? Fine, hit the &#8220;Home button&#8221; and come back to the first app when you&#8217;re done, picking it up just where you left it.<br /><br /><b>Mobile devices are changing our expectations</b><br /><br />While the emphasis in the discussions about the mobile revolution often seems to be on portability and the business opportunities of mobile apps, let&#8217;s not forget about how all these mobile devices are changing the way people interact with computers and their expectations. <br /><br />We are already seeing examples of how the iPad and similar devices are influencing web design, and I definitely think that&#8217;s a positive trend that will make more and more web destinations feel more natural and uncluttered. Now is the right time to take a look at the web sites we build and maintain, and figure out how to make it more mobile and consequently human friendly.<br /><br />And the end result will not be something just the less tech savvy users will enjoy; I think we can all benefit from less clutter and distractions. After all, it makes much more sense to have interfaces that adapt to the way people think, than to have people adapt to interfaces they have to use.<br /><br />Additional readings:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.inspiredm.com/2010/02/09/ipad-design/">How iPad Affects the Way we Design Websites? | Inspired Magazine</a></li><li><a href="http://memeburn.com/2011/01/4-ways-tablet-computing-is-influencing-web-design/">4 ways tablet computing is influencing web design | memeburn</a></li><li><a href="http://mashable.com/2010/09/30/ipad-web-design/">How the iPad Is Transforming Web Design (case studies) | Mashable</a></li><li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzgleuEUz0o">Apple Previews Mac OS X Lion | YouTube @BNETvideo</a>&nbsp;</li></ul><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2011/01/mobile-single-tasking-leads-way-to-more.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2011/01/mobile-single-tasking-leads-way-to-more.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

Teachers can easily export content into SCORM and add it to Moodle. Great for our teachers because it&#8217;s also available in Slovenian (and other languages).<br /><br /><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/TQ5rhbtZZwI/AAAAAAAAAo8/rkmx4SLaNOw/s1600/xmind.png" /> <a href="http://www.xmind.net/" target="_blank">Xmind</a> - an open source brainstorming and mind mapping tool.<br /><br /><b>Google tools</b><br /><br /><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/TQ5tgXklaiI/AAAAAAAAApM/N1HENR1GrNE/s1600/google+doc.png" /> <a href="http://docs.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Docs</a>&nbsp;- easy to use collaborative tool for documents, spreadsheets and presentations.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/TQ5u53A1JEI/AAAAAAAAAp4/6Go9EEV8dII/s1600/google+sites.png" />&nbsp;<a href="http://sites.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Sites</a>&nbsp;- a simple tool for creating web pages.<br /><br /><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/TQ5thrMpl4I/AAAAAAAAApQ/xoFzhCPld5M/s1600/blogger.png" /> <a href="http://www.blogger.com/" target="_blank" title="Blogger">Blogger</a>  - free, simple to use blogging platform. If my grandpa can use it, so can your non-tech savy teachers and students. Love the fact that you can have private blogs, available only to specified readers.<br /><br /><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/TQ5tibaty-I/AAAAAAAAApU/WYC_w-qqcMI/s1600/picasa.png" /> <a href="http://picasa.google.si/" target="_blank" title="Picasa">Picasa</a> and&nbsp;<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/" target="_blank" title="Spletni albumi Picasa">Picasa web albums</a>&nbsp;- Google&#8217;s free image organizer and editor that also supports free web albums. I admit - I don&#8217;t really use Picasa (I have iPhoto on my Macs), but my grandpa loves it, so I like to recommend it to non-Mac folks.<br /><br /><b>Multimedia</b><br /><br /><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/TQ5tjFlrthI/AAAAAAAAApY/0YrajWoNtqA/s1600/screentoaster.png" /> <a href="http://www.screentoaster.com/" target="_blank">ScreenToaster</a>  - free online screen recorder.

Again, as an iLife user, I don&#8217;t really use it myself, but I know a lot of teacher who use it in classrooms.<br /><br /><b>Anywhere, anything</b><br /><br /><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/TQ5tks7CDWI/AAAAAAAAApg/Ps9t08sFH1Y/s1600/evernote.png" /> <a href="http://www.evernote.com/" target="_blank">Evernote</a>  - my absolutely favorite tool for notes and what not. I use it to write drafts fro blog posts or messages for my students, to save notes while grading, as a collection of links and ideas and so much more. I love the fact that it&#8217;s both a desktop and online app, so you can really access all your notes from anywhere (even on my mobile phone).<br /><br /><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/TQ5tmD-KHbI/AAAAAAAAApo/coM1Z_rehds/s1600/google+reader.png" /> <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/" target="_blank">Google Reader</a> - web RSS reader.

I even know teachers that use Dropbox to collect student&#8217;s assignments, and it&#8217;s also great as a personal backup tool and as a way to collaborate on files with others.<br /><br /><b>Sharing</b><br /><br /><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/TQ5tnfZ7T2I/AAAAAAAAApw/qgnL-XEHozI/s1600/slideshare.png" /> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/" target="_blank">SlideShare</a>&nbsp;- my favorite tool for sharing presentations that can easily embedded almost anywhere on the web.<br /><br /><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/TQ5tn52Z0YI/AAAAAAAAAp0/FmwKjCICbJg/s1600/scribd.png" /> <a href="http://www.scribd.com/" target="_blank">Scribd</a>&nbsp;- simple tool for publishing docs and embedding them almost anywhere on the web.<br /><br /><br />And that&#8217;s it, that&#8217;s the list of tools I like to show to teachers starting to explore digital learning and learning. Yes, yes, I know there are many other tools that would deserve to be on the list, so I also provide a link to Jane Hart&#8217;s amazing&nbsp;<a href="http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/recommended/top100-2010.html">Top 100 Tools for Learning 2010 List</a>&nbsp;(but a list of 14 items is usually easier to digest for beginners).<br /><br />So, here&#8217;s my questions for you: which 14 tools would your put on your list, while keeping in mind they should be easy enough for beginners and freely available on all platforms? Let me know in the comments!<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2010/12/14-great-tools-for-teaching-learning.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2010/12/14-great-tools-for-teaching-learning.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
I recently came across the following short movie about the mind games runners face when choosing to run and challenge themselves on a daily basis. I think it&#8217;s a great snapshot if internal battles that go through our heads when we try to do something outside our comfort zone:<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><object height="340" width="560"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/ly7JSRj_9K8?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/ly7JSRj_9K8?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="340"></embed></object></div><br />Yes, it&#8217;s hard to go out and run with temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius, it&#8217;s hard to go out and run in rain or even snow. And when you do it, the internal battles don&#8217;t end. You think you won&#8217;t be able to run more than a mile today, your legs are heavy, the water puddle appears out of nowhere and your feet are wet now&#8230; The list of &#8220;reasonable&#8221; excuses seems endless.<br /><br />And this isn&#8217;t specific to running, of course. We play that sort of mind games when it comes to other tasks that are difficult and (usually) non urgent. Going into super productive mode when facing a deadline or pressure from someone comes naturally to us, but when you <i>choose</i> to do something for your own good, like a New Year&#8217;s resolution&#8230; ah, that&#8217;s when the mind games come into play.<br /><br />And it&#8217;s that sort of mind games I personally often face when it comes to blogging. I&#8217;ll finish this blog post tomorrow&#8230; What if my ideas aren&#8217;t good enough? Someone is better at this than I am&#8230;<br /><br />But if there&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve learnt from running on my own, it&#8217;s that the effort pays off in the end. Mind games are part of the challenge, and the trick is to take it slowly, one run at a time, stick to your schedule, and not let the bad runs stop you. Oh yes, there will be bad runs in the mix, you can count on it. But in the end it&#8217;s those runs that count the most and make you stronger. Because afterwards, you feel like a hero, and you won the game against the part of you that wants to keep you safe by doing nothing.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lululemonathletica/5197327623/" title="inspire by lululemon athletica, on Flickr"><img alt="inspire" height="373" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4129/5197327623_dde9c65af0.jpg" width="560" /></a></div><br />So, what are you waiting for? Go take that run, publish that blog post that has been collecting dust as a draft for way too long now, take the trip you&#8217;ve always wanted to take, start that big personal project you&#8217;ve been putting off. Just don&#8217;t fear the bad runs.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2010/12/embracing-mind-games-and-bad-runs.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2010/12/embracing-mind-games-and-bad-runs.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

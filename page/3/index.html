<p>I&#8217;ve got a confession to make. There is a new website that is capturing an increasing number of spare minutes in life. It provides an endless stream of visual inspiration, and every time you use it, you can&#8217;t help but feel a bit more creative. Yep, I&#8217;m in love with <a href="http://pinterest.com/"><b>Pinterest</b></a>, the latest over-hyped tech media darling.</p>I did try to resist it, I swear. When I saw the first blog posts about it, I thought I didn&#8217;t need a service like that. I tried to convince myself that Tumblr and Instagram were enough for me. And I didn&#8217;t want to fall into the whole &#8221;<a href="http://www.maternalinstinct.com/2011/11/21/5-reasons-pinterest-catnip-women/">women love Pinterest</a>&#8221; stereotype. But then, as the hype kept growing, I gave in to my curiosity and a professional dedication to trying out all the new cool social services in town. And I haven&#8217;t looked back ever since. Why is that, and why does it matter?<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://pinterest.com/" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wwpX6y87uyI/TyAEYExDXDI/AAAAAAAAAJA/aB5Dro8MNOQ/s1600/pinterest-ialja.jpg" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div></div>

<p>I know it&#8217;s super trendy to be anti-Facebook and looking for more &#8220;open&#8221; or less &#8220;evil&#8221; alternatives like Google+ or Diaspora. But after the massive changes announced at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/f8">Facebook&#8217;s f8 developer conference</a> on Thursday, I feel like it&#8217;s time I say this out loud: <b>I love Facebook.</b></p><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-bottom: 6px; padding-left: 6px; padding-right: 6px; padding-top: 6px; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZOgt-V-8Vhs/Tn4prNgF9qI/AAAAAAAAAIg/M9-C8RchFlg/s1600/facebook-timeline-new-profile.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="259" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZOgt-V-8Vhs/Tn4prNgF9qI/AAAAAAAAAIg/M9-C8RchFlg/s400/facebook-timeline-new-profile.png" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="font-size: 14px; padding-top: 4px; text-align: center;"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999; font-size: x-small;">Facebook, one of my favorite web destinations<br /></span></i></td></tr></tbody></table><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">Skating to where the puck is going to be</span></b><br /><br />I love Facebook as a service, and I love Facebook as a company. I completely agree with MG Siegler from Techcrunch on this: Facebook is becoming the new Apple, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/22/button-down/">skating to where the puck is going to be</a>, and leaving the competition baffled in dust, miles behind.<br /><br />Sure, change and innovation are often difficult to accept for the now almost 1 billion strong mainstream Facebook user base. Even a minor repositioning of a button is bound to make someone upset. <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/pl/state_web_winter/facebook_layout">For a week or so</a>.<br /><br />And that&#8217;s why I have even more respect for Facebook: despite being very mainstream, they are not afraid to innovate. They could easily sit on their asses for a year or two and wait for Google+ or something else to catch up. Instead, they choose to run head first into the questions nobody is even asking yet, and often finding answers nobody else can think of. Like Apple, Facebook is still able to maintain the mentality of a startup and has the guts to challenge the status quo.<br /><br />Do they get it right every time? No, of course not. But you&#8217;re bound to make mistakes if you&#8217;re trying hard to be the first and the best in what you do. The tricky part is knowing how to recover from your falls, move on, and find the next big thing that will change people&#8217;s lives forever.<br /><br />This might seem like a big statement; after all, Facebook is just a social network, right? Well, it seems like they have bigger plans than that. The folks at Facebook are really hard at work trying to find the best ways for people to connect online. And not by pilling up features, but by rethinking the way we connect to each other on a human level.<br /><br />And <i>human</i> is the keyword to the two major changes announced on Thursday. Firstly, completely redesigned user profiles, now called Timelines. And secondly, the new generation of Facebook apps that enable social experiences, and finally make seem the semantic web a step closer to reality. Let me explain why I&#8217;m so excited about all these new features.<br /></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Yesterday I came across a <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apps/2011/08/11/subjot-a-twitter-alternative-that-lets-you-curate-content/">blog post on TNW</a> on <a href="http://subjot.com/"><b>Subjot</b></a>, a Twitter alternative. Yeah, I know. At first, I rolled my eyes. (Yet) another Twitter is probably not what we need. But I&#8217;m glad I read the post anyway and discovered that Subjot actually offers a solution to a Twitter dilemma I&#8217;ve been having lately and builds an interesting product centered around discussion on top of it.<p>I wouldn&#8217;t really call Subjot a Twitter alternative. It actually works quite well with Twitter, and in a way provides a middle way between Twitter and Facebook, providing a public space for discussions based around topics user define themselves. Call me crazy, but I actually see Subjot as Google+ done right. Intrigued? I sure do hope so, because I think Subjot is a nice little gem with a lot of potential and a harbinger of a larger trend. Let me explain why.</p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>
 <tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HJuByKNjFvk/TkVpkxG9MvI/AAAAAAAAAHY/F-KKCIMbnHA/s1600/subjot-splash.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HJuByKNjFvk/TkVpkxG9MvI/AAAAAAAAAHY/F-KKCIMbnHA/s1600/subjot-splash.png" /></a></td></tr>
 <tr style="color: #999999;"><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Subjot: &#8220;Talk about your favorite subjects. Let your friends choose what to follow.&#8221;</i></td></tr>
 </tbody></table><a name='more'></a><div style="color: #e69138;"><b>The human flaw behind Google+ Circles</b></div><br />Ok, first, let&#8217;s get the <a href="https://plus.google.com/">Google+</a> elephant out of the room. Here&#8217;s a confession: I don&#8217;t like Google+. Yes, it&#8217;s new, it&#8217;s shiny, it has a neat interface, and has the privilege to sit on top of all Google services we love and use often. I was thinking about writing a blog post about Google+, but these two blog posts describe what bothers me about it more eloquently than I could:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://kevnull.com/2011/07/can-we-ever-digitally-organize-our-friends.html"><b>Can We Ever Digitally Organize Our Friends?</b></a>: the post does a great job at explaining what Google+ Circles (and grouping friends in general) do right and why they suck. Spoiler alert: we&#8217;re not really good at categorizing people in groups, and every worse at maintaining the categorization; the lines are often too blurry.</li>
 <li><a href="http://www.allfacebook.com/dont-believe-the-hype-2011-07"><b>Reality Check: Google Plus Is No Facebook Or Twitter Killer</b></a>: nice explanation of the problem sharing with Circles creates. Spoiler alert: again, we&#8217;re really bad at deciding what other people are interested in.</li>
 </ul>It&#8217;s not that I think Google+ doesn&#8217;t have potential. It sure does. And Google is very serious about it, so I think that&#8217;s a rare social Google product we&#8217;ll have to learn how to live with. I don&#8217;t think it will kill Facebook; in fact, I see it as a closer threat to Twitter. But unless the majority of friends I interact with the most on Twitter and Facebook ditch Twitter/FB in favor of Google+, I really don&#8217;t see myself actively using it.<br /><br /><div style="color: #e69138;"><b>Subjot&#8217;s selling point: you get to decide which subjects you want to follow</b></div><br />Now, back to <a href="http://subjot.com/"><b>Subjot</b></a>. The main idea behind Subjot that makes it unique is that we all have different interests we like to talk about. For instance, I&#8217;m interested in education, mobile technologies, running and cats, just to name a few subjects.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>
 <tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-x3PtW_4pPP4/TkVz0gzBWMI/AAAAAAAAAH0/mxi5T38P-mU/s1600/ialja-interests-instagram.001.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-x3PtW_4pPP4/TkVz0gzBWMI/AAAAAAAAAH0/mxi5T38P-mU/s1600/ialja-interests-instagram.001.jpg" /></a></td></tr>
 <tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i style="color: #999999;">A few of my interests - and you probably don&#8217;t want to read about all of them </i></td></tr>
 </tbody></table>Now, when a person follows me on Twitter or friends me on Facebook, she will get my updates on all of these subjects. But my dear follow just might be a dog person that doesn&#8217;t think my cat is special (gasp!), which might lead her to unfollow/unfriend me because of my annoying cat updates.<br /><br />Yes, Google+ is built around the idea that you share content only with a circle of friends that will find certain content interesting. The problem is that I don&#8217;t always know who out of my friends likes cats. Meaning, some of my friends might end up missing important updates on my&nbsp;awesome&nbsp;cat! (terrible thought, I know)<br /><br />And this is where Subjot finally comes into the picture: on Subjot, my followers decide which of my subjects they want to follow. Each jot I share has a subject. And if some of my followers are fellow runners, they can follow just the updates about running. If they are interested in social media, they can follow just my updates on social media and ignore all cat posts (although, to be honest, cute cats have always been a big part of social media!).<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>
 <tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3NnQEUhXH78/TkVuLUuAtrI/AAAAAAAAAHg/fWriEmJf580/s1600/subjot-follow-options.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="227" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3NnQEUhXH78/TkVuLUuAtrI/AAAAAAAAAHg/fWriEmJf580/s320/subjot-follow-options.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr>
 <tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i style="color: #999999;">Your feed, you get to decide which updates you want to get. There are a lot of different follow options for each person you want to keep an eye on.</i></td></tr>
 </tbody></table><div style="color: #e69138;"><b>Subjot subjects are not just (hash)tags </b></div><br />I know what you might be thinking: it&#8217;s like using hashtags on Twitter or tagging your blogs posts. Well, yes and no. For one, Twitter doesn&#8217;t let you filter your friends&#8217; content by hashtags. If a person you follow tweets excitedly about a conference you&#8217;re not attending, your feed gets really noisy and there&#8217;s nothing you can do unless you unfollow your friend temporarily (rude, I know!). <br /><br />And while you can use several hashtags on Twitter and on your blog, Subjot only has one subject per update. And I think that&#8217;s brilliant because it keeps the service simple. You don&#8217;t have to understand tagging to categorize content on Subjot. Just pick a subject, it&#8217;s that easy!<br /><br />Plus, the user interface for choosing subjects is pretty<i></i> smart. You are always offered the three most common subjects you use in the form of nice, big buttons, and an autocomplete tool helps you reuse subjects you or your friends have already used.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>
 <tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BXorGbNOORM/TkVu8y468FI/AAAAAAAAAHk/WSCpVIfqo9A/s1600/subjot-choosing-subject.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BXorGbNOORM/TkVu8y468FI/AAAAAAAAAHk/WSCpVIfqo9A/s1600/subjot-choosing-subject.png" /></a></td></tr>
 <tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i style="color: #999999;">Choosing a subject on Subjot - so easy, my cat could do it</i></td></tr>
 </tbody></table>&nbsp;And you can also Explore popular subjects on Subjot and find users that job about certain subjects to follow. Again, you don&#8217;t have to follow everything they post, just the subjects you&#8217;re interested in.<br /><br /><div style="color: #e69138;"><b>Encouraging discussion with comments and notifications</b></div><br />So, is Subjot just Twitter with the ability to categorize content and fine-tune areas of interest you follow? Luckily, no. Twitter is all about fast, instant sharing - and it&#8217;s really, really good at that! What it&#8217;s not so good at, is keeping track of discussions. You can RT and reply to tweets, of course, but those actions are usually relevant just in that instant.<br /><br />On the other hand, Subjot borrows two very important features from the Facebook side of the fence: the ability to comment on shared content and notification about other people&#8217;s comments. Consequently, Subjot offers a really nice, public space for discussion.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>
 <tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jvAj0PR0cio/TkVvne7qcwI/AAAAAAAAAHo/8i6g1U3heI8/s1600/subjot-comments.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jvAj0PR0cio/TkVvne7qcwI/AAAAAAAAAHo/8i6g1U3heI8/s1600/subjot-comments.png" /></a></td></tr>
 <tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i style="color: #999999;">Example of a jot with comments</i></td></tr>
 </tbody></table><div style="color: #e69138;"><b>Bridging the gap between Twitter and Facebook with elegant simplicity</b></div><br />Yes, unlike Facebook, where a lot of people choose to have private profiles, Subjot in a public discussion place. Here, again, it comes closer to Twitter, where most sharing is public. So, we can describe Subjot as both as Twitter with better support for discussions or as a public Facebook with asynchronous connections (you don&#8217;t have to follow people who follow you). And that&#8217;s the beauty of it.<br /><br />Subjot is not trying to replace either Twitter or Facebook. In fact, it plays nice with both. Whenever you post of Subjot, you can send your updates to Twitter or Facebook or both. And you can easily find friends on Subjot by connecting your Twitter and Facebook accounts.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>
 <tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZjLogAdOpn4/TkVxVkoNp7I/AAAAAAAAAHw/nQMcQH_ehn4/s1600/subjot-add-Twitter-Facebook.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZjLogAdOpn4/TkVxVkoNp7I/AAAAAAAAAHw/nQMcQH_ehn4/s1600/subjot-add-Twitter-Facebook.png" /></a></td></tr>
 <tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i style="color: #999999;">You can share your jots on Twitter and/or Facebook</i></td></tr>
 </tbody></table>I also like the fact that the creators didn&#8217;t try to cram too many features in the service right from the start. For instance, there are yet no &#8220;Likes&#8221;, reposts, special privacy settings. And in a way that  is ok. I think that at this stage, it&#8217;s smart to let the users figure out how and what they want to use Subjot for. <br /><br />What intrigues me about Subjot is that it isn&#8217;t really trying to clone any of the big, existing social networks, but it&#8217;s providing a fresh, simple, elegant twist on the way we discuss our interests online. Of course, the big challenge for this little gem is attracting enough users that will (hopefully) start forming passionate communities around subjects.<br /><br /><div style="color: #e69138;"><b>Subjot&#8217;s potential as a discussion platform and the question of privacy</b></div><br />And I do think there is a lot of potential for different types of communities to embrace Subjot. For instance, I can see Subjot being used in education, with teachers and students sharing course related content with the ability to follow just that content and not get updates about their teacher&#8217;s cooking recipes (unless they want to).<br /><br />Of course, as we start to imagine such use cases, the question of privacy also emerges and it&#8217;s one that Subjot hasn&#8217;t addressed yet. For instance, it might be interesting to have the ability to have private subjects and allow followers to view post on those subjects only after approval or upon invitation.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">&nbsp;<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SHglCyUzpaA/TkV3BnemtZI/AAAAAAAAAH4/hK_kO612prY/s1600/conversation.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SHglCyUzpaA/TkV3BnemtZI/AAAAAAAAAH4/hK_kO612prY/s1600/conversation.jpg" /></a></div>Perhaps there&#8217;s also a monetization opportunity in there - go pro and create unlimited private rooms for certain subjects? Ads and sponsored content could also be interesting opportunity for Subjot down the road. But of course, growing the user base and keeping a close eye on how users are using Subjot should be the main priority in the early stages of the product.<br /><br /><div style="color: #e69138;"><b>The big picture: can the Subjot approach cut down the social networking noise?</b></div><br />I think it&#8217;s pretty clear by now that there is something about Subjot that really excites me. I really think Subjot is onto something with this idea of allowing users to follow specific areas of interests when they choose to follow certain people. Of course, we yet have to see how the Subjot approach scales up, but I think a few things are pretty clear by now.<br /><br />First, we all have different interests we like to talk about, and usually our friends don&#8217;t share <i>all</i> our interests with us. Second, there is a need to cut down the noise in social networks. Third, we are not so good at predicting what are friends are interested in and neither are machines (yet). Is the Subjot approach a good solution for all of this? I don&#8217;t know, maybe it is.<br /><br />But I certainly think we&#8217;ll start seeing more and more social networks trying to cut down the noise by filtering content based on users&#8217; interests. For instance, just recently, Facebook started experimenting with the aggregation of news feed stories by topic. Isn&#8217;t the next logical step in this story &#8221;<i>More about topic X&#8221;</i> and <i>&#8220;Less about topic Y&#8221;</i>? Not to mention the increasing number of iPad news app that are trying to figure out what content you like and serve you a highly personalized selection of content based on your friends and behavior.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>
 <tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EfXCrQvA78Q/TkVwGCMsi5I/AAAAAAAAAHs/M02XGyOT3DE/s1600/Facebook-aggregated-posts-by-topic.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EfXCrQvA78Q/TkVwGCMsi5I/AAAAAAAAAHs/M02XGyOT3DE/s1600/Facebook-aggregated-posts-by-topic.jpg" /></a></td></tr>
 <tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i style="color: #999999;">Facebook is trying to get smart by grouping news feed posts by topic</i></td></tr>
 </tbody></table>&nbsp;We&#8217;ll see who does a better job at filtering content - humans (on Subjot or even Google+) or smart algorithms (on Facebook and all those fancy news apps). But it&#8217;s certainly something that will be an important competitive advantage in the coming years. After all, I don&#8217;t hear anybody complaining about there not being enough content online, but you can hear a lot of complaints about social networks being too noisy and good content hard to find.<br /><br /><div style="color: #e69138;"><b>Still with me? Good, now give Subjot a try!</b></div><br />Anyhow, thanks for bearing with me through this ridiculously long post. If you did, I do hope you&#8217;re now ready to give Subjot a try. If you want to connect with me there, just sign up using this link: <a href="http://sjot.it/qwwPUQ">http://sjot.it/qwwPUQ</a>.&nbsp;I really do think that Subjot deserves a fair chance, and I&#8217;m really interested in seeing the direction and shape it will take in the future.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2011/08/subjot-bridging-gap-between-twitter-and.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2011/08/subjot-bridging-gap-between-twitter-and.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">The mission: find a new home for my online hub</span></b><br /><br />Not long after Steve Jobs announced <a href="http://www.apple.com/icloud/">iCloud</a>, a free service that would replace (and, quite honestly, dramatically enhance) the existing paid <a href="http://www.apple.com/mobileme/transition.html">MobileMe service</a>, it was clear that those of us that were using MobileMe to host our iWeb website <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2011/06/12/rumor-steve-jobs-iweb-mobileme/">would have to look for a new home</a>.<br /><br />Which, for me, meant looking for alternatives for hosting my online hub @ <a href="http://ialja.com/">iAlja.com</a>. Until recently, my online hub was a simple iWeb website that pointed to all my profiles around the web that I&#8217;m using actively, and had a few extra pages for an extended bio and featured work. Nothing complicated, and I liked it that way.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sadooByLa-I/TiWeAwIHOfI/AAAAAAAAAHE/zjnM64SEamo/s1600/ialja-iweb-website.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="266" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sadooByLa-I/TiWeAwIHOfI/AAAAAAAAAHE/zjnM64SEamo/s400/ialja-iweb-website.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999;">Goodbye, old iWeb website!</span></i></td></tr></tbody></table><p>But apparently time had come to find a new home for my online hub; a journey, which ended up on Tumblr. So, read on if you want to know why I chose Tumblr and how I&#8217;m using this micro-blogging platform as my personal website.</p><a name='more'></a><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">Comparing alternatives for a personal online hub&nbsp;</span></b><br /><br />I started my journey with relatively simple requirements. I didn&#8217;t have a lot of content, so I didn&#8217;t need a complex CMS behind the website. I could have just transferred the website to different host, but I also wanted a simple way to edit the content whenever it was needed, without having to deal with HTML files and FTP upload.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-20_Tj4TomY8/TiXMvVsR1BI/AAAAAAAAAHU/oxM5W1Z0zSQ/s1600/website-alternatives.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-20_Tj4TomY8/TiXMvVsR1BI/AAAAAAAAAHU/oxM5W1Z0zSQ/s1600/website-alternatives.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999;"><i>So many different &nbsp;options&#8230; which one to choose?</i></span></td></tr></tbody></table>At first I considered transferring everything to a hosted <a href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress blog</a> and purchase extra options such as the ability to use my own domain name, customs designs etc. But that seemed like an overkill, considering that I wouldn&#8217;t be using most of the features of a system like WordPress. I already have my main blog on Blogger, and I like it just the way it is.<br /><br />And yes, I could have just added a few extra pages to this <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a> blog and use my domain to point directly to this blog, but I wanted to keep it as a separate place. After all, it already has several links pointing to its content (or so I like to think ;)), so I didn&#8217;t want to fix what wasn&#8217;t broken.<br /><br />I also didn&#8217;t want my domain to point to a profile on a social network, even though <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/11/how-to-build-an-audience-on-the-internet-the-kevin-rose-school-vs-the-fred-wilson-school/">I hear it&#8217;s fashionable</a> to direct your domain to <b>Google+</b> these days. Partly because I&#8217;m not a fan of Google+ yet, but mainly because I still wanted a more unique look and more flexibility when it comes to the content, design and layout of my hub.<br /><br />The next option I looked at were simple to use web builders, such as <a href="http://www.weebly.com/">Weebly</a> or <a href="http://www.moonfruit.com/">Moonfruit</a>. Both offer a simple web editor and the premium upgrade options for using your own domain and other goodies. I actually started recreating my old website in Weebly, but I felt the editor was a bit too limited (compared to the flexibility I was used to in iWeb), and I didn&#8217;t really like any of the templates.<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">Revisiting Tumblr as a personal website</span></b><br /><br />Then, finally, I decided to have a closer look at <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>, a minimalistic blogging platform that has been getting a lot of attention lately. I&#8217;ve had a Tumblr blog (ialja.tumblr.com) since January 2009 and I occasionally used it to share different types of content. I&#8217;ve always liked it because it was simple to use and allowed me to share smaller bites of content that were&#8217;t full sized blog posts, but yet I could share more in a Tumblr post than I can on Twitter.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OqUvRM-TH5M/TiWduOqx_qI/AAAAAAAAAHA/c7QOUmuTSQ8/s1600/tumblr-post.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="91" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OqUvRM-TH5M/TiWduOqx_qI/AAAAAAAAAHA/c7QOUmuTSQ8/s400/tumblr-post.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />I&#8217;ve read people were using Tumblr as their personal websites, so I was curious to see what I could turn my existing Tumblr blog into. I know I could add static pages to the blog, but was there a way to make the blog look less like a blog and more like an online hub? In other words, was there a way to display some static content right on the first page without the latest post getting all the attention?<br /><br />As it turn out, the answer was yes. You just have to find the right theme.<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">Tumblr&#8217;s secret sauce: powerful, great looking themes</span></b><br /><br />Tumblr has many great features that are making it <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/06/15/tumblr-surpasses-wordpress/">increasingly popular</a>, such as&nbsp;the simple, yet powerful editor for content of different types and the dashboard that makes it really easy to reshare, like and follow content posted by members of the Tumblr community. But one of my personal favorite features of Tumblr is the rich <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/themes/">Theme Garden</a>, which features all sorts of&nbsp;amazing looking themes.<br /><br />Tumblr themes aren&#8217;t just pretty to look at, but can also help you to use Tumblr for different purposes. There are themes for designers/photographers that can turn Tumblr into a <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/top-10-free-tumblr-themes-create-portfolio/">portfolio</a>, professional looking themes for <a href="http://www.sparkplugdigital.com/blog/an-introduction-to-tumblr-for-business/">business websites</a> and much more. And here&#8217;s the best part: you can get a lot of great looking themes for free!<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1ES09_CAkQk/TiXKFJUqpvI/AAAAAAAAAHQ/L0hB8HDndC0/s1600/tumblr-themes.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="323" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1ES09_CAkQk/TiXKFJUqpvI/AAAAAAAAAHQ/L0hB8HDndC0/s400/tumblr-themes.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999;">A few examples of Tumblr themes</span></i></td></tr></tbody></table>Ok, I confess: I spent quite a few hours browsing through different themes in the Theme Garden and on different websites. I&#8217;ve never imagined I&#8217;d have so much fun playing virtual dress up with my blog! But there&#8217;s also another thing you should take into consideration when choosing your Tumblr theme: the customization and advanced options it provides.<br /><br />For instance, I was looking for a theme that would let me choose custom colors for links and titles, had the ability to easily add Disqus for comments, and my Google Analytics tracking ID. Yes, you can also do all that by fiddling with custom HTML, but why bother if you can find an awesome theme that does all that work for you?<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">The Single A Tumblr Theme: sticky post, featured tag and more</span></b><br /><br />Well, lo and behold, at the end I ended up finding the perfect theme for just what I was looking for. It&#8217;s called <a href="http://singleatheme.tumblr.com/">Single A Theme</a>, it&#8217;s free (!), and provides some features that I haven&#8217;t found in any other Tumblr theme and lots of cool customization options. The key feature of this theme is certainly the ability to have a sticky post at the top of the blog - perfect for an online hub!<br /><br />So, here&#8217;s how my online hub <a href="http://ialja.com/">iAlja.com</a> looks now with this great theme:<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KKWPUqBtHEE/TiWe09gToQI/AAAAAAAAAHI/0qxTMiSrF90/s1600/ialja-new-website.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="302" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KKWPUqBtHEE/TiWe09gToQI/AAAAAAAAAHI/0qxTMiSrF90/s400/ialja-new-website.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999;">New, simple look for my online hub&nbsp;</span></i></td></tr></tbody></table>It&#8217;s simple, it has just the colors I wanted, and it works. I&#8217;m using the sticky post feature of the theme to display an intro text with all the key links at the top, and I also use Tumblr&#8217;s Pages to display static content from my old website (<a href="http://ialja.com/about">About</a>, <a href="http://ialja.com/featured">Featured Work</a>). In addition to that, I&#8217;ve also added a link to this blog in the menu, so it&#8217;s easily accessible from any page.<br /><br />The theme also allows me to display me latest tweets in the sidebar, and I can use the Tumblr blog to post quick thoughts or interesting content I come across. For longer posts, such as this one, I still use my main Blogger blog, and then just post a link to the post on the Tumblr blog.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-W0K3m46MTNQ/TiXICE4M1SI/AAAAAAAAAHM/wF5EezYpMoY/s1600/single-a-customization-tumblr.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="228" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-W0K3m46MTNQ/TiXICE4M1SI/AAAAAAAAAHM/wF5EezYpMoY/s400/single-a-customization-tumblr.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999;">Single A Theme: l</span></i><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999;">ots of customization options&nbsp;</span></i></td></tr></tbody></table><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">Thumbs up for Tumblr!</span></b><br /><br />All in all, I&#8217;m really happy with this solution and with my newly discovered online home. I found Tumblr to be flexible enough, while simple to use. Yes, it might take a little while to find the perfect theme, but once it&#8217;s set up, you can just focus on posting content.<br /><br />It&#8217;s so simple, I even decided to open another Tumblr blog dedicated to <a href="http://runjourney.tumblr.com/">running</a>. The fact that it&#8217;s ok to share bite size content on Tumblr encourages me to share more, and to do it faster, without getting in the way.<br /><br />So, if you&#8217;re looking for a simple way of sharing content that you can make your own with a unique look, and a great community on top of that, Tumblr is definitely the way to go. Thumbs up for Tumblr!<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2011/07/making-tumblr-my-online-home.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2011/07/making-tumblr-my-online-home.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Recently I was invited to prepare a guest lecture for a small group of business and management students attending an E-learning course as part of their Summer School in Koper. I was told to choose a topic that would be fresh, something that students don&#8217;t get to hear about that often in regular classes.<br /><p>And that&#8217;s why I decided to put together an <b>overview of some of the key trends in the mobile industry</b> that are already influencing the way we study, work and socialize, and will probably be an increasingly important part of our day to day life. You can find the slides and the video of my lecture, as well as a text recap, in this post.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2aUbDxvFBiA/ThYi-IEQddI/AAAAAAAAAG4/JeD6QsZPcPQ/s1600/mobile_trends_lecture-ialja.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2aUbDxvFBiA/ThYi-IEQddI/AAAAAAAAAG4/JeD6QsZPcPQ/s1600/mobile_trends_lecture-ialja.jpg" /></a></div><a name='more'></a><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Lecture slides with additional resources</span></span></b><br /><br />Because choosing just a few trends, just a few technologies wasn&#8217;t easy, I decided to prepare slides that students could also use to explore parts of the lecture they found most interesting in more details. That is why I added a lot of links to current articles with cases studies, stats, analysis and what not. You can view all of the slides embedded below.<br /><div id="__ss_8505250" style="width: 510px;"><strong style="display: block; margin: 12px 0 4px;"><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ialja/5-key-mobile-trends-youshould-know-about" target="_blank" title="5 key mobile trends you should know about">5 key mobile trends you&nbsp;should know about</a></strong> <iframe frameborder="0" height="426" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/8505250" width="510"></iframe> <br /><div style="padding: 5px 0 12px;">View more <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/" target="_blank">presentations</a> from <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ialja" target="_blank">Alja Isakovic</a> </div></div><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Don&#8217;t like flipping through slides? Here&#8217;s a recap.</span></span></b><br /><br />To sum it all up in a more coherent form, here are the 5 key mobile trends I decided to highlight:<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #3d85c6;">1. Mobile devices are making learning (and other activities) more magical</span></b><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rdamdLBTkgI/ThYe6jYoreI/AAAAAAAAAGk/uKosOTlfIS0/s1600/magic_touch_apple.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rdamdLBTkgI/ThYe6jYoreI/AAAAAAAAAGk/uKosOTlfIS0/s1600/magic_touch_apple.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">The magic of touch (source: </span></span></i><a href="http://www.apple.com/education/"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">Apple</span></span></i></a><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">)</span></span></i></td></tr></tbody></table>Interactive content is nothing new. What is new is the way mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets (that include smart sensors and touch screens) allow us to physically touch the content. It does feel a bit like magic, touching just isn&#8217;t the same as clicking with a mouse. It&#8217;s more intuitive, more personal. It gets to you.<br /><br />And while today apps like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-edAGLokak">Our Choice</a> are often seen as fun gimmicks that you can use to impress an audience, I believe that in a few years we&#8217;ll wonder how we&#8217;ve ever settled for learning with content we couldn&#8217;t touch directly. Ok, make that a couple of more years; we all know most edu folks aren&#8217;t exactly early adopters. But I believe that someday the shift will happen, because touch just feels so natural to all of us. <br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #3d85c6;">2.

Apart from satisfying our desire to help <a href="http://www.rovio.com/index.php?page=angry-birds">angry birds</a> get revenge on those naughty, egg-stealing pigs, mobile apps (and the development ecosystem Apple envisioned) are teaching everyone some important lessons. There are many reasons why apps are so successful. The most obvious one is because they are just so much more awesome and magical, if you will, than our desktop software.<br /><br />But another very important lesson (one that Apple already learned with the iTunes Store) is that we don&#8217;t mind paying for digital content if it&#8217;s easy and convenient to do so and if the content provides us with enough value. And, on the other side of the fence, we are eager to develop good content  if we get the chance to earn a few bucks and be the coolest kid in town aka the app store of our choice.<br /><br />The application stores are also making business models that rely on selling virtual content (in-app purchases) more popular and widely acceptable. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m stretching it too far if I predict that in a few year we&#8217;ll be spending 99 cents on fancy templates for Microsoft Office. Right within the software, or app, as we&#8217;ll all be calling it by then. One click, ka-ching! Of course, Apple will probably the first one to offer in-app purchases in Pages ;) Which all leads us to the next trend&#8230;<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #3d85c6;">3.

Full screen apps, a new app launcher, the Mac App Store, heavily integrated gestures&#8230; Yep, Apple has learned a lot from iOS, their mobile operating system, and it&#8217;s bringing most&nbsp;of it&nbsp;(including the App Store business models) to their big, desktop OS.<br /><br />And don&#8217;t think this is just an Apple fad - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p92QfWOw88I">Windows 8</a> will also look like Windows Phone 7&#8217;s big brother. It seem like we&#8217;ve got no choice but to adapt to seeing our desktops becoming some sort of clumsier mobile device with a big screen.<br /><br />Not to mention websites also all want to look like apps. And <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/">HTML5</a>, CSS3 &amp; co. will make that all possible. Expect to see more websites that look and behave like apps or at least websites that will be smart enough to have the decency to self adjust to your screen size and even device type. I sure do hope to see more responsive design on the web in the coming years.<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #3d85c6;">4.

Where to start? It&#8217;s pretty clear that adding location data can make many services more useful and even fun. From local searches that help you discover cool nearby places, to the phenomena of telling all your friends not just what you&#8217;re doing, but also <i>where</i> you&#8217;re doing it and getting specials or offers in return, mobile payments and mobile commerce taking off, geo-fences that enable location reminds, ad-hoc social networks based on location, and&#8230; and&#8230; and&#8230;<br /><br />There is A LOT going on, so I really suggest you take a look at some of those additional links provided in the slide deck above. There&#8217;s no doubt that relying on location data to enhance services is a big trend that is just starting to evolve. As a side note, it is of course also worth noting that we have a lot of open questions about privacy and trust to figure out yet, especially when it comes to sensitive location data.<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #3d85c6;">5.

The new wave of cloud services from all the big boys are all trying to making it easy for us to access our content, data and files from any of the devices we own.<br /><br />And while most people, who today know very well computers just aren&#8217;t to be trusted, are still skeptical of all these promises (it does look a bit like science fiction, doesn&#8217;t it?), I think in a few years we&#8217;ll all get adjusted to things just working seamlessly through the cloud. <br /><br />And that is probably the master trend to rule them all - the technology is slowly getting out of the way, fading in the background, while allowing us to be the forgetful, spontaneous, touch fixated human beings that we all are.

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Yesterday&#8217;s <a href="http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/11piubpwiqubf06/event/">Apple Keynote at WWDC 2011</a> was full of big announcements. No shiny hardware upgrades this time, but a lot of great stuff coming up for our desktops with <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS X Lion</a>, our mobile devices with <a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/ios5/">iOS 5</a> and a solution to keep it all nicely synced together, <a href="http://www.apple.com/icloud/">iCloud</a>.<br /><br />I&#8217;m still digesting all the new announcements, but here&#8217;s one particular feature of iOS 5 that I think could really be a huge hit in our classrooms: <a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/ios5/features.html#more"><b>AirPlay Mirroring</b></a>.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QEbEDSeQPHI/Te3XtGlWBPI/AAAAAAAAADo/5Q5liiyUmKw/s1600/airplay2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="230" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QEbEDSeQPHI/Te3XtGlWBPI/AAAAAAAAADo/5Q5liiyUmKw/s320/airplay2.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>AirPlay Mirroring brings the ability to mirror your <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/">iPad</a> screen through <a href="http://www.apple.com/appletv/">Apple TV</a>. You can see a short demo in the video I&#8217;ve embedded below.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/fp14M7yQV-0#t=3m46s" width="560"></iframe></div><p>Now, imagine this setting: instead of hooking your classroom overhead projector to the painfully slow computer on the teacher&#8217;s desk, connect it to the $99 Apple TV. And then use AirPlay Mirroring on your iPad to share presentations, your web browser or any of the 90,000 (!) beautiful <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/from-the-app-store/education.html">apps for the iPad</a>.</p>And the best thing? You&#8217;re free to walk around the classroom and let your students interact with the apps. <br /><br />There are of course already several iPad apps that can help you turn your tablet into an <a href="http://www.speedofcreativity.org/2011/03/24/ipad-as-an-interactive-white-board-for-5-or-10/">inexpensive, portable interactive white board</a>, but with this set up you could do so much more. It&#8217;s not limited to an app - you can do anything you can do on your iPad. Not to mention the setup is super portable, so you can take it along to any classroom you visit, not just at your own school.<br /><br />Unfortunately, AirPlay Mirroring isn&#8217;t out yet; it will be available in fall with the release of iOS 5. But I still think we&#8217;ll be seeing some nice uses of iPads hooked up to the not very expensive Apple TVs through AirPlay Mirroring. Bringing the magic of the iPad to the classrooms or meeting rooms, enabling people to work together just by passing the tablet around the room.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2011/06/ipad-airplay-mirroring-and-apple-tv-new.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2011/06/ipad-airplay-mirroring-and-apple-tv-new.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

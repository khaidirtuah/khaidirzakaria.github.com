After <a href="/2007/03/thinking-about-3d-web-or-is-it-web-30.html">my previous post</a> on my thoughts about the future 3D Web, I got some really interesting comments. We were also wondering who the next big player in the 3D virtual worlds game would be and guess what? The first video I see this morning is a trailer from Sony about Home, a new community based service for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Network">Playstation Network</a> (thanks <a href="http://exterior.trevor.smith.name/2007/03/so_damn_pretty.html">Trevor</a> for this one). Take a look by yourself:<br /><div  align="center"><object height="350" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/7_bDPpFhdZg"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/7_bDPpFhdZg" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="350" width="425"></embed></object></div>Looks familiar? Yep, it&#8217;s their version of <a href="http://www.secondlife.com">Second Life</a> with some great features to connect gamers. And it does look soooo pretty. But what it doesn&#8217;t look like (at least from this trailer) is an open environment. It is limited to a single console and my first impression is that it is a very sterile environment. Maybe a bit too much.<br /><br />Anyhow, I take Sony&#8217;s Home community as a sign that virtual 3D communities are getting big and that that the digital natives of the next generation will probably will be very comfortable with virtual worlds and the ability to travel between different worlds - just as today&#8217;s natives are comfortable with <a href="http://www.myspace.com/">MySpace</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">FaceBook</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a>. However, I do hope that more open alternatives (<a href="http://www.croquetconsortium.org/">Croquet</a> and <a href="http://ogoglio.com/">Ogoglio</a> are worth mentioning again) will be available on the market. It is also up to us - the users, consumers - to support open source projects and demand more open environments. Let&#8217;s not just settle for the first cute thing that comes around; we <span style="font-weight: bold;">can</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">should</span> have so much <span style="font-weight: bold;">more</span>!<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/03/another-thought-about-3d-web.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/03/another-thought-about-3d-web.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
I&#8217;ve been doing quite some thinking about virtual 3D worlds recently. <a href="http://www.secondlife.com/">Second Life</a> and different <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMORPG">MMORPG</a> games are getting an impressive amount of coverage in traditional media and that in my opinion is a sign that something important is going on. That is also why I&#8217;ve decided to write a short piece on virtual worlds and virtual economies for students that will be taking the E-business course this year. Virtual worlds are growing and shouting for attention, and we just can&#8217;t pretend they don&#8217;t exist anymore.<br /><br />The edu blogoshpere has been noticing virtual worlds for quite some time now. A few days ago Vicki Davis wrote an interesting post <a href="http://coolcatteacher.blogspot.com/2007/03/frontier-of-education-web-3d.html">The frontier of education: Web 3D</a> that looks at virtual 3D worlds from an educational perspective. She did a great job when identifying some of important potentials of virtual worlds for education:<br /><ul style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153); font-style: italic;"><ul><li>You can overcome stereotypes</li><li>Student Collaboration</li><li>Authentic Assessment / Project Based Learning Possibilities</li><li>Role Playing</li><li>Potential for group synergies</li><li>Storage, Legacy, and Global Audience</li><li>Scenario Simulation</li><li>Digital Storytelling</li></ul></ul>She ends her post with the question <span style="font-style: italic;">What do you think?</span> and in this post I&#8217;d like to share some of my recent thoughts on the development and future of virtual worlds.<br /><br />From my experience, a great potential of virtual worlds is also the greater presence of non-verbal forms of communication. That is perhaps the feature of virtual worlds that I personally find very attractive. It&#8217;s what (at least for me) makes the virtual world seem almost real. I love the way avatars get bored if you leave them standing on one spot, I love the way they look busy while typing and the fact that you can make your own gestures and poses is not only entertaining, but also very real-life like. Virtual worlds can in my opinion to some extent also be used to <span style="font-weight: bold;">learn and practice non-verbal communication</span>.<br /><br />I also think that the <span style="font-weight: bold;">therapeutic potential</span> of Second Life is very important. People with different forms of autism are finding Second Life very positive (read the article <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7012645/">Virtual world teaches real-world skills</a>), Second Life is also used to <a href="http://www.secondlifeherald.com/slh/2007/02/interview_with__1.html">fight agoraphobia</a> (fear of open spaces) and it can also help us understand each other better through simulations. A few days ago I ventured into the <a href="http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/psychiatry/research/virtual.html">Virtual Hallucinations</a> building that simulates schizophrenia. I must say this experience had a huge impact on me and Imy perception of this disease (if you can&#8217;t or don&#8217;t want to visit the place, you can read this <a href="http://nwn.blogs.com/nwn/2004/09/a_lever_to_move.html">personal account of the experience</a> on Second Life Herald).<br /><br />I definitely agree with Vicki that virtual worlds have great educational potential and that they will play a big part in our future. However, I do share <a href="http://seanfitzgerald.wordpress.com/2007/03/06/cool-cat-teacher-gets-it-the-future-of-the-web-and-maybe-online-learning-will-be-3d/">Sean FitzGerald</a> &#8216;s reservation towards Second Life - I hope Second Life as it is will not be the future of the web or the core of Web 3.0.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/Re1OVtav5II/AAAAAAAAAD8/kgFsFtscBLE/s1600-h/ialja-wondering-sl.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 417px; height: 187px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/Re1OVtav5II/AAAAAAAAAD8/kgFsFtscBLE/s400/ialja-wondering-sl.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5038769692973458562" border="0" /></a>Here are a few things I think need to be done for a better user experience and a move towards a 3D Web or Web 3.0 that can be accepted by a greater number of users (and of course educators):<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Open protocols and standards</span><br />Just as Sean pointed out, I also hope that we&#8217;ll have more open standards that the whole community has decided on. The Web 3.0 is supposed to be about <a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?main=/articles/art0689.html">open technologies and open identity</a> - I hope we manage to integrate that in virtual worlds. I think it&#8217;d be great if your avatar could shoot movies in Second Life and directly upload them to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a>, or take snapshots and upload them on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a>. Basically, I think that we need better connectivity among all our virtual worlds and social networks.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /><br />Better accessibility<br /></span>Last night I wanted to go into Second Life to take some snapshots for the study material I was preparing for my students and guess what? I couldn&#8217;t log on, the grid was shut down due to some maintenance (without prior warning). This is also what happened when I first tried to enter Second Life. Not a very warm welcome, right? In Second Life they have scheduled maintenances at least on a weekly basis (usually sometime on Wednesdays). Yeah, it&#8217;s great that they take care of the grid, but I these downtimes are too disruptive. In real world you don&#8217;t get kicked out of your classroom once a week because the maintenance guys need to fix the classroom. The Second Life environment isn&#8217;t very stable, and at the moment it is still often buggy, which is a problem if you&#8217;d want to use it for education.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /><br />Cross platform support<br /></span><a href="http://www.moove.com/">Moove</a>, <a href="http://www.kaneva.com/">Kaneva</a> seem like great worlds, but I can&#8217;t yet get in them. Why? Because I&#8217;m on a Mac. I&#8217;d really like to be able to choose between different virtual worlds, but I&#8217;m stuck with Second Life for now. That is why I also think it&#8217;d be great to make virtual worlds work in web browsers. Some great projects that are trying to achieve that are under development - <a href="http://www.opencroquet.org/">Croquet</a> and <a href="http://ogoglio.com/">Ogoglio</a>. I just watched some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=4D6218D4770DA10B">screencasts about Ogoglio</a> on YouTube and I must say I&#8217;m really impressed. (The world is still quite crude, but it looks very promising. The way it displays pictures and text from other websites through XML looks amazing - especially when compared to Second Life!).<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /><br />Better Web 2.0 support</span><br />Second Life may look like the next generation of Web, but when you really think about it, it lacks some Web 2.0 features that we all came to like. Some things that I miss: a more powerful search (where is Google? :) ), the ability to tag objects (and people), I&#8217;d also love to see recommendations for places and objects (users who bought this also liked&#8230;, users that visited this place also enjoyed&#8230;). You do have some sort or a rating system, but here is what <a href="http://secondlife.com/knowledgebase/article.php?id=409">the  official Second Life</a> site has to say about that:<br /><blockquote style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">&#8220;Ratings have no functional effect on your Second Life — they&#8217;re vanity numbers, and some Residents prefer to do other things with their L$ than rate, such as uploading (from File menu) new media to use in their inworld creations.<br /><br />Tip: if you wonder how someone came to have ratings in the high hundreds of even thousands, it&#8217;s likely because they&#8217;re an older Resident, from a time when ratings cost L$1 apiece.&#8221;</blockquote>Great. Ratings have no functional effect and you have to pay to give them? Hm, doesn&#8217;t really sound like Web 2.0 to me&#8230; I sure hope the Web 2.0 features and values will not be forgotten or lost in the Web 3.0!<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />Improved mobility</span><br />Soon we&#8217;ll be able to use <a href="http://secondlife.reuters.com/stories/2007/02/08/comverse-demos-second-life-on-mobile-phones/">virtual worlds on our mobile phones</a>, but I also hope that more virtual world will provide the ability to do some work offline. We do have all sorts of mobile devices that can get us online, but the Internet isn&#8217;t available everywhere, especially when we travel. Just like I can write this blog post without being connected to the Internet, I think it&#8217;d be cool to be able to, for example, edit your avatar offline. (Moove already supports this - I hope it becomes a standard feature in virtual worlds).<br /><br /><br />So, these are just some thoughts about potential improvements of virtual worlds. I already wrote some thoughts about the potential future of 3D virtual world in <a href="/2007/02/ialja-writer-reports-from-second-life.html">my introductory post about Second Life</a>. I like the idea of a 3D Web future, but I agree with Vicki - we need to support further development of virtual world that will be safe, enjoyable, user friendly and easy to control in educational settings. As educators I think we should talk about potentials and problems of 3D world and encourage our colleagues to try out new technologies. You don&#8217;t really fully understand a technology unless you try to use it and really experience it first hand - as Vicki puts it: &#8220;second life learning is first person learning&#8221;. I hope all these discussions we are having will motivate more educators to explore virtual worlds and share their personal experiences. I find personal accounts of Second Life adventures and explorations much more valuable and interesting to read than official manuals. Do not be afraid to try out virtual worlds and if you think you can&#8217;t handle it on your own, ask for help! I&#8217;m more than willing to give you a short introductory tour, and I know that so are many other educators that are working in Second Life.<br /><br />And now is your turn dear reader - what is your opinion about virtual worlds? Do you think we&#8217;ll be able to use the potential they are offering us? Are we ready for the shift into virtual 3D workplaces?<br /><br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192);">By the way - some interesting resources for those interested in virtual economies:</span><br /><ul style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192);"><li>Betsy Book - <a href="http://www.bcs.org/server.php?show=ConWebDoc.3336">Virtual Worlds: today and in the future</a></li><li>Edward Castronova - <a href="http://ssrn.com/abstract=338500">On Virtual Economies</a></li><li>Thomas M.

I know <a href="http://www.flickr.com/" target="_blank">Flickr</a> has been around for quite some time, but until now I haven&#8217;t really felt the need to use their service. I didn&#8217;t have many photos to share, and I wasn&#8217;t particularly interested in searching for other people&#8217;s photos either. However, Flickr has been on my to-join list for some time because of its potential educational uses, and today I finally took the time to create an account. Primarily I wanted to do this so I could share the graphics I&#8217;ve created so far for my blog, because until now you only got access to my graphics in separate posts and that really isn&#8217;t very Web 2.0 ;) So, here it is, my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/sets/72157594557416601/" target="_blank">iAlja blog graphics set</a>.<br /><br />I also wanted to try out the Groups feature of Flickr, so I created <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/moodle/" target="_blank">The faces of Moodle</a>, a group where I&#8217;d like to see the looks of different Moodle sites around the world. So, feel free to join me on Flickr, and if you have a Moodle site please post a screenshot of it to my group (and don&#8217;t forget to put it on the map ;) ).<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/02/playing-with-flickr.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/02/playing-with-flickr.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Today I wanted to share with you an <span style="font-weight: bold;">interesting experience</span> about using comics to help students with their first login to our e-classroom. Let me do by explaining a bit of background to the story. Many of the courses at out faculty are in some way or another supported by our e-classroom (based on <a href="http://www.moodle.org/" target="_blank">Moodle</a>) and so most of our students need the access to our e-classroom to get study materials or participate in other study activities. For their first login students are asked to enter their unique student number as their username and password (which they can of course change later). This works for most of the students, though some students (like those that enrolled after the official beginning of the study year) don&#8217;t yet have an account created, because they weren&#8217;t included in the transmission of student data from the faculty&#8217;s information system. Yes sure, we could figure out a better way to automatically create student accounts, but the current system works well for most students.<br /><br />Now, all I&#8217;ve just described above was clearly explained to our students on the first page of our e-classroom. We provided students with short and concise instructions on what they should do on their first login and what they should do (email our Center for e-learning) if that didn&#8217;t work. We thought the instructions were clear enough, but a great number of students disagreed. We were getting a dozen mails per day by confused or frustrated students that couldn&#8217;t get in the e-classroom and were asking for help. Many mails did not include the information we asked students to include when asking for help. And we saw that as a big problem. Clearly, too many students were not able to properly understand (decode) the given instructions. Also, they were experiencing <span style="font-weight: bold;">confusion and frustration</span>, which is definitely not something you&#8217;d want students to experience when first meeting a new technology. First impressions matter, right?<br /><br />This problem has troubled me for some time. I was trying to think of better ways to explain the login procedure to students and the solution that helped to solve at least a bit of the problem was found almost by chance. I almost accidentally stumbled upon the post <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/MartinHardee/entry/design_comics_templates_1_0" target="_blank">Design Comics Templates 1.0, Part I</a> on <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/MartinHardee/" target="_blank">Martin Hardee&#8217;s  blog</a>, which provided wonderfully illustrated characters and scenes that can be used for comic storyboards. I immediately fell in love with the pictures and started thinking about ways in which I could use them. At first it was almost a joke, but I decided to make a short comic explaining the login process of our e-classroom. The pictures were perfect for this. I used <a href="http://plasq.com/comiclife" target="_blank">Comic Life</a> (the basic version comes free with Mac OS X) to create the comic and we decided to put them on the first page of our e-classroom, above the written instructions. The <a href="http://www.eucilnica.si/" target="_blank">login page of our e-classroom</a> now looks like this:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/Rd_-0947-QI/AAAAAAAAADw/DKGMuiwn1vA/s1600-h/e-classroom.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 292px; height: 234px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/Rd_-0947-QI/AAAAAAAAADw/DKGMuiwn1vA/s320/e-classroom.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5035023094343530754" border="0" /></a>And I was actually surprised by the fact that the comic almost immediately helped to lower the number of mails we receive and that students requesting login now included all the required information (just the way the girl in the comic does). Wow! I didn&#8217;t believe it would make such a <span style="font-weight: bold;">noticeable difference</span>, but it does. It seems that our students pay more attention to the content of the comic than they did to the content of the written instructions. No serious research has been done about this (at least yet :) ), but a few students already responded to the short survey about the comic that we posted in the e-classroom and they all said the instructions in the comic are easier to understand than the written ones before.<br /><br />So, the reason for which I&#8217;ve decided to share this experience with you was that it has reminded me that we sometimes have to <span style="font-weight: bold;">look outside the box</span> to find a better solution to our problems and that too often we forget how valuable pictures and illustrations really are. For students that are faced with a new environment I guess it&#8217;s easier to understand a comic that shows a similar situation to what they&#8217;re experiencing in the same moment. It is after all in human nature to learn from observation and also to feel closer to content that has &#8220;a human face&#8221;. Spoken or written language is a great and powerful way to communicate, but we must not forget other forms of communication, especially the visual. I should know that - after all, I do have a bit of background in graphical design.<br /><br />I was also reminded about this by <a href="http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=39066" target="_blank">Stephen Downes</a>, who wrote that he really liked my &#8220;Click. Learn. Share.&#8221; icons (and I even got a mail about them this morning :) ). Sometimes words just are not enough and we should never forget that we have many powerful ways that can help our words to be heard - especially in the noise of everyday life. I think that can be a challenge for all of us, but especially for educators. Verbalized <span style="font-style: italic;">text</span>books have ruled the past, but we need to learn new forms of communication. I think this will be increasingly important if we&#8217;ll want to get the attention of the digital natives that are slowly taking over the world and that are discovering the power of visual communication through YouTube, MySpace, Flickr and other visual channels.<br /><br />I think the proper way to end this post is to ask all of you to share your stories of how words were not enough. Why should this be done? To <span style="font-weight: bold;">inspire</span> new experiences and to serve as a reminder that creative solutions are key to the challenges of the 21st century.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/02/when-words-are-not-enough.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/02/when-words-are-not-enough.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

At last! I am happy and proud to announce that the first Moodle Moot in Slovenia will be held on May 18th 2007 in Koper, Slovenia. Moodle Moots are conferences for <a href="http://www.moodle.org/" target="_blank">Moodle</a> users that Moodle lovers organize all around the world (more info can be found <a href="http://moodlemoot.org/" target="_blank">here</a>). Since we opened <a href="http://www.moodle.si/" target="_blank">Moodle.si</a> (an online community for Moodle users in Slovenia) it&#8217;s also been our wish to organize a live event where Moodle users can meet in person and exchange tips and tricks ;-) Now, after a few months of planning, meetings and ideas of all sorts we are finally a step closer to making our wish come true.<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RdnXh947-PI/AAAAAAAAADk/asoI6qs10zc/s1600-h/kartica.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand; width: 278px; height: 149px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RdnXh947-PI/AAAAAAAAADk/asoI6qs10zc/s320/kartica.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5033291037112269042" /></a>More info about our <span style="font-weight: bold;">moodle.si </span>conference can be found <a href="http://www.moodle.si/moodle/mod/resource/view.php?id=65" target="_blank">here</a>, although the site is in Slovenian language only. If you don&#8217;t understand Slovenian and would like to know more about the conference  or even participate in some way, please feel free to leave a comment on this post or email me :-)<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/02/first-moodle-moot-in-slovenia.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/02/first-moodle-moot-in-slovenia.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
The video Web 2.0 &#8230; The Machine is Us/ing Us by Michael Wesch that <a href="/2007/02/web-20-in-less-than-5-minutes_05.html">I posted last week</a> made me think quite a lot about my personal relationship with Web 2.0 (or the Read/Write Web as some prefer to call it). I think that the concept of Web 2.0 can really be understood only if you use and explore its technologies and apply it on your own life. And I also think that reflecting on how Web 2.0 technologies affect our lives can provide additional valuable information. In this post I&#8217;d like to share with you my personal account and thoughts on what Web 2.0 means to me and what impacts it&#8217;s having on my daily life.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RdLEk1BxhoI/AAAAAAAAADI/yNe6RZqIWn8/s1600-h/click.png"><img style="margin: 0pt 5px 0px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 56px; height: 95px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RdLEk1BxhoI/AAAAAAAAADI/yNe6RZqIWn8/s200/click.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5031299870715119234" border="0" /></a>My typical day starts with a cup of coffee and a <span style="font-weight: bold;">click</span> on my browser icon. It&#8217;s strange now that I think about it, but the first thing I do in the morning (no matter what I have to do during a particular day) is to start my browser - Safari. I don&#8217;t stop to think - oh, I need my browser now! - I just do it. Just a few years ago I&#8217;d then type in the address of a news site, but now the first thing I check in my browser are the web feeds. I regularly try to organize and reduce the number of feeds I&#8217;m subscribed to, but usually I&#8217;m stuck between 50 or 100 feeds (and here I&#8217;m counting just the feeds I regularly read). I have my feeds organized in folders in Safari&#8217;s bookmark bar that is always visible. That allows me to see how many unread feeds I have at any given movement. It is a bit intrusive, but that&#8217;s the way I like it (most of the times). I&#8217;ve tried using applications and web sites to keep track of my feeds, but I always come back to Safari&#8217;s bookmark bar because it&#8217;s always there, always telling me hey! click on me, I&#8217;ve got news! And sometimes I do feel the pressure of all those unread feeds; I feel like I&#8217;m missing something if I don&#8217;t click them right away. Reading web feeds and following links they provide in a ways makes me feel connected. It gives me the feeling that I know what&#8217;s going on right now and what the most interesting topics on the net are.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RdLEaVBxhnI/AAAAAAAAADA/R-hTAP7PxS0/s1600-h/learn.png"><img style="margin: 0pt 5px 0px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 79px; height: 95px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RdLEaVBxhnI/AAAAAAAAADA/R-hTAP7PxS0/s200/learn.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5031299690326492786" border="0" /></a>The number of feeds makes me <span style="font-weight: bold;">read</span> a minimum of 10 posts a day (on a calm day that is), but it doesn&#8217;t just stop at reading and clicking links. Fact is that whenever I find an interesting post or link I immediately feel the <span style="font-style: italic;">need to share it</span>. A few years ago I&#8217;d perhaps email or IM the link to family or friends, but now it&#8217;s just much more. I feel the need to share it with the world - I don&#8217;t want just friends and colleagues to read this link, I want to give everyone in the world that might be interested in a certain topic a chance to read it! And so I always make sure to share the really interesting posts/links <span style="font-style: italic;">at least</span> on <a href="http://teachershare.org/" target="_blank">TeacherShare.org</a> or/and <a href="http://www.moodle.si/" target="_blank">Moodle.si</a>. Isn&#8217;t that interesting?<br /><br />Checking web feeds and sharing interesting links is just the beginning of my Web 2.0 connected day. Both activities continue throughout the day, no matter what I do. My browser is always with me, showing me new feeds, offering opportunities to share, to connect. During the day I of course do other things - research, write, create, innovate - and I think that now more than ever I also actively think about what I do, try to find meaning, try to extract valuable lessons etc. and what for? To <span style="font-weight: bold;">share</span> them on this blog.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RdLHHVBxhpI/AAAAAAAAADY/TNe2Qzrwe0s/s1600-h/share.png"><img style="margin: 0pt 5px 0px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 76px; height: 95px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RdLHHVBxhpI/AAAAAAAAADY/TNe2Qzrwe0s/s200/share.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5031302662443861650" border="0" /></a>Keeping a blog makes me an active seeker of content that will be interesting and relevant for you: the readers of my blog. I am now the editor of my personal channel and for this reason I feel a big <span style="font-style: italic;">responsibility</span> for the &#8220;life&#8221; of my blog - it is up to me to keep it interesting, current and worth reading. And all this also makes my primary work as a researcher more engaging, and even more valuable and meaningful to me. I feel that I can do much more than just the task in front of me. I am constantly learning, collecting experiences and thinking about how they could be shared for others to read. I try to write at least one post per week about what I currently do, what I am thinking about, what questions I am trying to answer&#8230; and I love the way my blog &#8220;obligation&#8221; is keeping me busy and active. If I can&#8217;t find any new valuable ideas in my work I am motivated to go elsewhere. On other blogs, where I can even interact with the authors and readers of those blogs. I have in fact became an active seeker or ideas that I try to transform into new content that can be shared with the purpose of inspiring new ideas. Wow!<br /><br />And though a lot of my usage of Web 2.0 technologies is work related, it certainly doesn&#8217;t stop when I stop working or thinking about work. In the evening when I try to relax and get away from the computer, usually my activities involve watching a movie, reading a book, playing games or just having a great conversation with my dear ones. One would think I forget Web 2.0 at this point - well, think again. The Web 2.0 is always at the reach of our hands. When deciding upon which movie to watch we go and check IMDB, see what other users say, or check out the list of the highest rated movies. The same happens when choosing books or games. It seems so normal that you look anything up on the net and see what others say - and in most cases what matters most is not the opinion of professional critics, but of ordinary people (though all <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1569514,00.html" target="_blank">persons of the year 2006 according to Times magazine</a>).<br /><br />I&#8217;m really amazed at what big part Web 2.0 plays in my life (and I in its life). In just a few years it has entered our lives from different doors and it&#8217;s growing stronger and more powerful days by day. And for this reason I agree with what Michael Wesch pointed out in his video - we really <span style="font-weight: bold;">need to rethink </span>a lot of things. Among these things I think that rethinking <span style="font-style: italic;">ourselves</span> is one of the key points. We are being linked in previously unthinkable ways and our lives are being changed. What kind of changes is that bringing us? Are the changes improving our lives or crippling the social aspect of our analogue real lives as some fear?<br /><br />The answers to these questions are many - and there should be. For me the most important changes are the feeling of <span style="font-weight: bold;">connectedness</span>, the feeling of <span style="font-weight: bold;">responsibility</span>, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">need to share</span> and the <span style="font-weight: bold;">trust systems</span> that the users of Web 2.0 are building among each other (just take for example <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>). These are the changes I find most valuable and that I hope I (and others) will be able to keep and use not just for a better and more useful Web 2.0, but also to build a better future - together, by connecting are ideas and constructing new worlds.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/02/living-web-20.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/02/living-web-20.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

I&#8217;ve been using Moodle in different roles (admin, tutor, user) for quite some years now, and I believe that Moodle is a great platform for e-learning because it&#8217;s powerful, relatively easy to use, and also expandable and customizable for different needs. What is also great is the fact that the Moodle developer community is very active and always making sure new versions have useful new features and improvements of previous standard modules.<br /><br />I had the pleasure to attend <a href="http://dougiamas.com/" alt="Creator of Moodle">Martin Dougiamas</a>&#8217; virtual presentation about the <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Roadmap">future of Moodle</a> at the Austrian Moodle conference a few days ago, and I&#8217;m really excited about some of the features we&#8217;ll be soon seeing in version 1.9, and also the roadmap for Moodle 2.0, which in my opinion has the potential of making Moodle 2.0 a great member of the Web 2.0 family. In this post I&#8217;d like to share with you some of my thoughts on the future of Moodle. I believe that Moodle has a <a href="http://www.oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/cs-moodle.xml">sustainable future</a>, so I&#8217;ll focus mainly on discussing upcoming Moodle features and possible future developments.<br /><br />Among Moodle 1.9 features that Martin presented on Thursday, I was most impressed by the added <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Student_projects/Social_Networking_features">social networking features</a>. I think it&#8217;s a great step towards making Moodle even more flexible and user friendly. If you&#8217;re a <a href="http://www.moodle.org/">Moodle.org</a> site user, make sure you edit your profile and add your interests and try finding users with common interests <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(check out the page for the tag &#8221;</span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://moodle.org/tag/index.php?id=1">moodle</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">&#8221; - cool, isn&#8217;t it?)</span>. Right now I sometimes feel limited by the rigid course structure in Moodle, and I really can&#8217;t wait to have a better way to connect with other Moodle users through tags and shared interests <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(similar to what </span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://elgg.net/">Elgg</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);"> offers)</span>. And one of the next steps is hopefully the ability to mark Moodle items (forum posts, resources etc.) as favorites, so each user could create his/her own library of favorite resources.<br /><br />However, another problem I&#8217;ve been seeing with Moodle for some time now from the perspective of a common user (i.e. student role with no editing rights), was not just being closed in courses, but also being closed and limited to a certain Moodle site. I often found the thought that students lose access to their Moodle resources/activities/data after a course or study year is over disturbing. Of course, teachers have many options to export/import content and date, and move content/data among their courses and among Moodle sites. But the students don&#8217;t have any easy way to export their work and move it to a new Moodle site or to their personal archive somewhere else. So, I think one of the next steps in Moodle development should also be empowering users and enabling them to create their library of resources and also their Moodle portfolio that they (the students, not the teachers or administrators!) could take to another Moodle site (when changing schools for example). The Moodle development <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Roadmap">roadmap</a> shows plans of enabling easier connections between different Moodle sites through the <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Moodle_Network">Moodle Network</a>, which plans to provide a Moodle <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Community_hub">Community Hub</a> for sharing content, user info, and enabling better peer interaction. However, I think that moving between Moodles should also be made easy for students, and not just for the teachers.<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/images_en/c/ce/Community.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 444px; height: 208px;" src="http://docs.moodle.org/en/images_en/c/ce/Community.png" alt="" border="0" /></a><a style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Community_hub">Moodle Community Hub (from Moodle Docs)</a><br /></div>What I&#8217;d also like to see, is improvements in helping students getting around their Moodle courses. Moodle provides a block, which shows <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Recent_Activity">recent activity</a> since the last login for each course, and also an overview of your course through the <a href="http://docs.mjavascript/en/My_Moodle">My Moodle</a> page <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(though I really wonder how many administrators/teachers/students are aware of this option?)</span>. Still, I think the overview of my courses pages could and should be further improved by adding more flexibility and customization options. This could be very important for large Moodle sites with a lot of activity <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(like the moodle.org site, which I find very challenging to follow!)</span>. What I would like to see on the overview page is something closer to <a href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=2207967130">Facebook News feed page</a>. Students should be able to control what appears on this page, in what order, and in how much detail. Some sort of personal dashboard with more user-centric widgets. Now you can of course add some standard blocks to the overview page, but I miss more tools to help the users organize and plan their learning activities and perhaps an option to set up custom e-mail alerts that relate to specific course events. I really don&#8217;t like to receive e-mails for every Moodle post in a certain forum <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(especially for the most active ones)</span>, but I think it&#8217;d be useful to be able to add a rule to receive an e-mail update whenever a new resource/activity is posted (in any of courses you&#8217;re enrolled in) or when new topics that match your interests (keyword watcher) are started.<br /><br />All in all I&#8217;m really excited about Moodle adding more social networking features and establishing better connections between different Moodle installations and also the rest of the web. With all these improvements I&#8217;m beginning to wonder if in the future we could see Moodle also become a standardized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Learning_Environment">personal learning environment</a> with users in control of their learning data and the ability to move from one Moodle site to another <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(of course with the choice of moving only necessary portions of your Moodle profile data/library/portfolio)</span>? We&#8217;ll see what future Moodle development brings us. I certainly think Moodle is worth keeping an eye on, and I can&#8217;t wait to get my hands on the upcoming Moodle versions :)<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/09/random-thoughts-about-future-of-moodle.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/09/random-thoughts-about-future-of-moodle.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
As you might have already noticed, my job description on LinkedIn, Facebook and on my blog has changed. Yes, it&#8217;s true, after weeks of planning and considering different options I finally decided to try something new and co-found a company - <a href="http://www.artesia.si/">Artesia.si</a> that will specialize in 2D and 3D virtual communities. We will be offering consulting for companies wanting to improve or build virtual communities, and I will mostly focus on testing new technologies, planning and delivering (e)learning for our clients, and on presenting our company in <a href="http://www.secondlife.com/">Second Life</a>. At least for now we&#8217;ll be focusing on the Slovenian market, so we only have a <a href="http://www.artesia.si/">website</a> in Slovenian. But we do have a <a href="http://slurl.com/secondlife/Silicon%20City/208/159/28">virtual office</a> in Second Life that you can all visit <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(yeah, we&#8217;re a real flat world company with no brick and mortar office :) )</span>. And things are actually already moving faster than we could hope for. On Thursday we were invited to help with a piece on Second Life for the <a href="http://24ur.com/naslovnica/novice/it/20070830_3104625.php">evening news on national television</a> in Slovenia! I have the video with English subtitles on <a href="http://profile.to/iAlja">Facebook</a> if you&#8217;d like to see how it turned out :)<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RtiAH3LGxQI/AAAAAAAAAGw/zofJPUe3wx8/s1600-h/artesia+office.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 456px; height: 353px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RtiAH3LGxQI/AAAAAAAAAGw/zofJPUe3wx8/s400/artesia+office.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5104971050182427906" border="0" /></a>But despite the fact that I&#8217;m changing jobs, I still intend to keep this blog alive. It will still remain my personal learning space, on which I&#8217;ll be talking about my personal learning experiences, emerging technologies, and of course the occasional random thoughts of a geek :) So stay tuned, and if you&#8217;ve got more questions about my new professional adventure let me know!<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/08/starting-up-new-adventure.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/08/starting-up-new-adventure.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RtU703LGxPI/AAAAAAAAAGo/KYfvp77VzPY/s1600-h/information.png"><img style="margin: 0pt 5px 0px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RtU703LGxPI/AAAAAAAAAGo/KYfvp77VzPY/s400/information.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5104051532044092658" border="0" /></a>Lately I seem to be stumbling a common problem a lot while surfing the web, visiting different places in Second Life or just going to different analogue places by analogue roads. That problem is <span style="font-weight: bold;">lack of good directions</span> related to different content and places.<br /><br />A common example: I often find an interesting blog post, and when I try to find more about the person that wrote it or the  purpose of the blog, there is nothing. Nada. On blogs, I often get my hopes up when I see the &#8220;About&#8221; page, but too often I find the default message to the owner of the blog that no visitor should ever see <span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">(something like: &#8220;Write something about yourself/your blog on this page&#8221;)</span>. I really don&#8217;t expect everyone to provide their full CV and contact information, but even if you decide to be anonymous, you can at least tell us what field you work in and what is the purpose of the blog.<br /><br />Then another common example from Second Life. I won&#8217;t even mention those places that are supposed to have a grand opening and can&#8217;t be found anywhere on the map or under search. What I find even more disturbing is getting to a new place and receiving no clue of what the place is about and no help for getting easily from one part of the sim to the other (i.e. teleporters).  Flying is fun in Second Life, but I don&#8217;t always have the time or will to fly from one corner of the sim to the other to see there is nothing really interesting on the other side.<br /><br />The immediate <span style="font-weight: bold;">reaction</span> to the lack of (good) directions is for me confusion, self-consciousness <span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">(thoughts like: are there really no directions here or is it my fault that I can&#8217;t find them?)</span>, and the final result is usually leaving the confusing place without plans to return in the near future. This confusing place should of course never be your online course site, your virtual world presence, or even your personal or professional website.<br /><br />So, <span style="font-weight: bold;">what can we do</span> to avoid users leaving our places, and how can we prepare good directions for our users (students, clients or friends)? Having really good directions is not an easy job I grant you, but I think there are some things we can do to get closer to that goal:<br /><ul><li>The first step is of course <span style="font-weight: bold;">recognizing that some directions are needed</span>. In our enthusiasm of building something new we often forget that.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Think like a newbie and like an average user </span>of your content when preparing directions, and (if possible) <span style="font-weight: bold;">test</span> them on a random person that was not involved in the design process and is not a super geek. If your grandparents can understand your directions you&#8217;re certainly on the right track!</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Make directions easy to read</span>, help yourself with simple <span style="font-weight: bold;">visual clues</span> (a map, icons etc.). Keep it <span style="font-weight: bold;">simple</span> and try to include the <span style="font-weight: bold;">basic information.</span> First time users/visitors don&#8217;t need to know all the details, but they should be able to get to those later when they need them.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Make directions visible for first time visitor, but not disturbing to frequent visitors</span>. Avoid using intrusive tools such as pop-up messages. The first time user might appreciate them, but only the first time. On the second visit he/she will start looking for the mute button, on the forth he/she will start looking for excuses for not visiting. </li><li>Not all directions should look like they&#8217;re there just because they have to be there. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Add value</span>: entertain your visitor, provide additional functions (i.e. teleporting in Second Life, a list of the most interesting posts etc.), make them feel welcome and appreciated.</li><li>Be polite to all users, not just those that you want to have today or those that pay you. You never know when you&#8217;ll need somebody, so try to <span style="font-weight: bold;">make a good first impression on everyone</span>.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Provide personal support options</span>. Even if you don&#8217;t manage to give good directions, you can be saved by giving your users/visitors/students and easy way to contact you and get personal directions from you or your staff. It&#8217;s the age of a user-centric web, on which we like the feeling we can all go talk to the boss if we want to.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Listen to user feedback.</span> And don&#8217;t listen just to the users that talk to you. Sometimes you have to make the first step and ask the users for feedback.</li></ul>These are just some of my guideliness for designing good directions (that don&#8217;t apply just to giving directions on the internet, but should also be considered in offline spaces!), but I would of course love to hear how you approach the task of providing good directions for your users. How do you, for example, provide directions for the students of your course or visitors of your website, online profile or blog?<br /><br />On my blog, I try to provide good directions by having a &#8220;Who am I?&#8221; block right on the top of the blog sidebar, which has some basic info about me and a few links to my extended profiles if the visitors want to know more about me. Also, I decided to visualize my blog purpose with a simple moto <span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">(Click. Learn. Share.)</span> and icons right below. I might also add some links to my most interesting posts in the future, but overall I hope I did a decent job in providing directions and different ways for navigation. If you think I&#8217;m missing something, please let me know :)<br /><br />I certainly think that once in a while we should all stop to think about how new users feel when they first enter one of our places. And I think we can often find some little and sweet details to add that will make the visiting experience for first-timers and regulars alike that more pleasurable and memorable.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/08/giving-good-directions.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/08/giving-good-directions.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

I admit that I&#8217;ve been reading many random things about many of you in the past weeks with quite some interest, so it&#8217;s only fair to do my share now :)<br /><br />First, <span style="font-weight: bold;">The rules:</span><br /><ol><li>Post these rules before you give your facts.</li><li>List 8 random facts about yourself.</li><li>At the end of your post, choose (tag) 8 people and list their names, linking to them.</li><li>Leave a comment on their blog, letting them know they’ve been tagged.</li></ol><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">My 8 Random Things:</span><br /><ol><li>I trained track and field athletics for about 10 years in different disciplines; I started in first grade in long distances, and ended up doing long jump and 60m/100m hurdles. I wasn&#8217;t too bad at it <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(even got into the national team once)</span>, but I quit because I lost my interest in competitions.</li><li>At the end of elementary school I wanted to study chemistry, but then lost all interest for it in high school and turned towards computer and social sciences.<br /></li><li>I love animation movies and cartoons in general. On my top list are Pixar movies <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(</span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://www.pixar.com/shorts/ftb/index.html">this short one</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);"> is imho enough to explain the brilliance of Pixar)</span> and Japanese sci-fi animes, but I like to watch just any animated thing that pops on screen.</li><li>I don&#8217;t like travelling much, especially by car. I keep hoping teleport systems will be invented in my lifetime :)</li><li>My interested for education highly derives from the fact that I was bored at school 90 % of the time, and I spent most of that time drawing various sketches in my notebooks.</li><li>I am shortsighted - couldn&#8217;t get far through the day without glasses or contact lenses! Part of it is inherited, and part of it is the price of being a computer geek and living behind computer screens.</li><li>I love the sea; now that I don&#8217;t live by the sea anymore, I really miss the sea air, and the wind you only get on the coast&#8230; And thinking of that always reminds me of the song &#8221;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gente_Di_Mare">Gente di mare</a>&#8221;.</li><li>I had compulsory Italian classes for 12 years in school as I lived in a bilingual zone (near the Slovenian-Italian border). And now I haven&#8217;t really spoken it for 5 years! I still understand it very well, but I don&#8217;t dare to speak or write it anymore - and that&#8217;s something I&#8217;d like to change.</li></ol>So, I hope you found my 8 random things interesting :) Now, I should tag 8 more people, but I feel like so many of you already played this game or been tagged, and I also don&#8217;t want to <span style="font-style: italic;">make</span> anyone play this game, sooo I will follow <a href="http://angelaathomas.com/2007/08/10/ive-been-double-tagged/">Angela</a>&#8217;s example <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(and </span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://www.storyofmysecondlife.com/?p=364">KJ</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">&#8217;s ;) )</span> and invite you readers of this blog, who want to be tagged and share with us 8 random things <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(I assure you: it is quite fun and painless! :) )</span> to leave a comment on this post and I&#8217;ll add you to the list, ok? :)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">List of great bloggers</span> that will be happy to share 8 random things:<br /><ol><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Daniel</span> <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(not a blogger (yet! ;) ), but he shared some interesting things in his comment)</span><br /></li><li><a href="http://cpappasonline.blogspot.com/">Christopher</a><br /></li><li style="font-style: italic;">position open</li><li style="font-style: italic;">position open</li><li style="font-style: italic;">position open</li><li style="font-style: italic;">position open</li><li style="font-style: italic;">position open</li><li style="font-style: italic;">position open</li></ol><br /><a href="http://eduspaces.net/davidds/weblog/"></a><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/08/catching-up-8-random-things-about-me.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/08/catching-up-8-random-things-about-me.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Ok, yes, I admit: <a href="http://twitter.com/ialja">I finally joined the Twitter fever</a>, and I am in fact enjoying it. All for higher research purposes only, of course. Ahem. Anyway, in this post I&#8217;d like to share with you some of my first findings/impressions about being a <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(still newbie! :) )</span> Twit.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RrBk0e-eHoI/AAAAAAAAAGE/69Jw2s13a2k/s1600-h/twitter.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 155px; height: 36px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RrBk0e-eHoI/AAAAAAAAAGE/69Jw2s13a2k/s320/twitter.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5093682031387090562" border="0" /></a>So, as you probably know by now, <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> is a simple web sites that keeps asking you and everyone else one simple question: <span style="font-weight: bold;">What are you doing?</span> And yes, people from all over the world answer this same question (in 140 characters or less) several times a day, and read answers their friends, acquaintances, or strangers <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(it&#8217;s the Internet after all!)</span> provide. <a href="http://edtechatouille.blogspot.com/2007/07/twitter-uniqueness-ambi-synchronous.html">Many are wondering</a> at <a href="http://weblogg-ed.com/2007/what-the-tweet/">what makes people Tweet</a>, but as with most Web 2.0 phenomena you can&#8217;t really know/understand what it is all about until you give it a try <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(and I mean really give it a try by <span style="font-weight: bold;">actively participating</span>!)</span>.<br /><br />Here are some of my ideas of why Twitter works. Actually, answering the question <span style="font-style: italic;">&#8220;What are you doing?&#8221;</span> on the web is not a new idea. <span style="font-weight: bold;">It&#8217;s been around for years in different communities</span>; I think that most (if not all) of the forums I used to participate in had an always popular topic <span style="font-style: italic;">&#8220;What are we doing right now&#8221;</span>, in which members would post short (one sentence) answers. These topics were always a great way to kill time, but also to build a special connection between forum members and strengthen the forum community. In these topics you were could read small little details about members&#8217; lives - their passions, dreams, joys, frustrations and what not - and you got the feeling that you knew them a little better.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.whywerock.com/wp-content/images/2007/01/twitterrific_logo.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 108px; height: 108px;" src="http://www.whywerock.com/wp-content/images/2007/01/twitterrific_logo.png" alt="" border="0" /></a>But of course, these &#8220;Tweet topics&#8221; were constrained to a certain web place - the forum - and people get restless if they are limited to one, same old, same old place. Especially because you can&#8217;t ever find <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> of your friends and other interesting people in just one place! And I think that&#8217;s where the folks at Twitter got a brilliant idea and offered the users the power to <span style="font-weight: bold;">connect socially across different places</span>. Sure, you still have to get a Twitter account, but once you get that, you can Tweet from anywhere you like - <a href="http://twitter.com/">the Twitter web site</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/blog/2007/05/theres-twitter-in-my-facebook.html">other websites</a>, your <a href="http://help.twitter.com/index.php?pg=kb.page&id=28">IM client</a>, your <a href="http://www.twitbin.com/">browser</a>, your <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/email_messaging/twidgettwitterdashboardwidget.html">dashboard</a>, your <a href="http://ordinalmalaprop.com/twitter/">Second</a> <a href="http://www.squawknest.com/about">Life</a>, your <a href="http://help.twitter.com/index.php?pg=kb.page&amp;id=14">mobile phone</a>,&#8230; and you can also read Tweets from your friends from any place you like! You are no longer limited to one application, one website - and I think we&#8217;ll be seeing more of that in the future of the Internet. For this reason<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Twitter is the ultimate social network - anywhere, anytime.</span> Saying &#8220;I have to go out&#8221; is usually the end of an IM conversation, but can be a start to a Twitter one! Once you set it Twitter up and find your friends, you just enjoy the ride and get connected with your social network - and along the way you can of course discover interesting Tweets from your friends&#8217; friends and expand your social network.<br /><br />Speaking of differences between Twitter and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging">IM</a>: people often ask why is Twitter different/better than IM? I think Twitter has some advantages over using IM. Firstly, it is not as time demanding, because you usually aren&#8217;t expected to reply immediately (although you easily can if you want to), and it takes away less time than having 10 separate IM conversations. But still - you are up-to-date with what your friends are doing, and can provide feedback if needed. And although Twitter can also be <a href="http://www.crucialthought.com/2007/07/24/twitterfox-dangerous-for-your-cognitive-health/">disruptive</a>, I think it is very easy to turn off notifications when you need to concentrate on doing something - and <span style="font-style: italic;">nobody actually knows you aren&#8217;t receiving notifications</span> (unlike with IM when your contacts know when you&#8217;re offline).  One of my Twitter friends <a href="http://twitter.com/anyaixchel">anyaixchel</a> found a perfect word to describe the communication process on Twitter: <a href="http://angelaathomas.com/2007/07/31/the-writing-and-communication-process-in-facebook-and-twitter/"><span style="font-weight: bold;">ambi-synchronous</span></a>. I find Twitter communication really fascinating. It is very simple, but yet it connects people in an almost magic way. And again - I think its main advantage is that it is not limited to one single place, but is in a way <span style="font-weight: bold;">universally accessible</span> no matter where you are.<br /><br />And because of that characteristic I believe that Twitter can be used in many different ways: as a travel journal <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(the expenses of sending an SMS on the road are often much lower than trying to find a computer with internet access in some places)</span>, as a flash news feed <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(see </span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://twitter.com/reuters">example</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">)</span>, as an <a href="http://twittercal.com/">event reminder</a>, as a tool for class notifications <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(I wish we had Twitter when I was in school!)</span>, and many more. The Twitter mania is just starting, so I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll all be able to find many other innovative usages of this new tool.<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RrBkFe-eHmI/AAAAAAAAAF0/JXU1g3Xm5lI/s1600-h/twitter+ialja.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 287px; height: 238px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RrBkFe-eHmI/AAAAAAAAAF0/JXU1g3Xm5lI/s320/twitter+ialja.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5093681223933238882" border="0" /></a><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">My Twitter starting (but not the only!) point</span><br /></div>Until then you are of course all invited to follow <a href="http://twitter.com/ialja">me</a> (or anybody else ;) ) on Twitter, and maybe we can come up with some new ideas together while Tweeting about less or more important events and thoughts of our lives :)<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">By the way: Twitter is not the only bird on the block. One interesting (and great looking!) variation of Twitter is for instance <a href="http://www.jaiku.com/">Jaiku,</a> which is also great for aggregating different feeds you might have (blog, Flickr, del.icio.us etc). Have a look at <a href="http://ialja.jaiku.com/">my Jaikus</a> for an example. Unfortunately Jaiku doesn&#8217;t (yet) support IM notifications, and so it is not as place independent as Twitter. </span><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/08/what-makes-twitters-tweet.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/08/what-makes-twitters-tweet.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
In the past few weeks I&#8217;ve been curiously exploring <a href="http://ialja.jaiku.com/">Jaiku</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/ialja">Twitter</a>, and even <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(more about those in future posts)</span>; and that is mostly why I haven&#8217;t been posting to my blog as much as I would like to. Another thing I&#8217;ve been doing is trying out different virtual worlds (<a href="http://www.there.com/">There</a>, <a href="http://www.kaneva.com/">Kaneva</a>, <a href="http://www.multiverse.net/">Multiverse</a>, &#8230;). I was curious to see if Second Life is really the best in social virtual worlds we currently got. And I must say I now appreciate my Second Life more :)<br /><br />The reason behind my &#8220;virtual worlds exploration&#8221; is that I will probably have to do some introductory presentations about virtual worlds (and in particular Second Life) in the next few months, and that is also why I spent the past week making a &#8220;master presentation&#8221; on the subject. My goal was to create a presentation with a brief explanation of what virtual worlds are, of what is Second Life, and of different things we can do with Second Life. And here is the result:<br /><div align="center"><object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="https://s3.amazonaws.com:443/slideshare/ssplayer.swf?id=83940&doc=virtual-worlds-introduction-second-life-and-beyond4228" height="348" width="425"><param name="movie" value="https://s3.amazonaws.com:443/slideshare/ssplayer.swf?id=83940&amp;doc=virtual-worlds-introduction-second-life-and-beyond4228"></object></div>I think this presentation can be used for different audiences by taking out some slides, so I hope you will also find it useful for some of your presentations. As it is meant as an introductory presentation, I didn&#8217;t focus on details, but rather on presenting the key facts and some of the most attractive aspects of virtual worlds and Second Life. I posted the presentation on SlideShare along with comments for each slides with links to sources I used, so I suggest you take a look at those comments as well. And of course: your comments/suggestions regarding this presentation are welcome either on SlideShare or on this post :)<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/07/presentation-second-life-and-beyond.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/07/presentation-second-life-and-beyond.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
For me, one of the important questions I <span style="font-style: italic;">always</span> have to answer before creating any kind of content is: in which language will it be? Will it be in Slovenian (my mother tongue) or in English (the international language of the web that I&#8217;ve learned as a second language)? This was, of course, also a major question when I started this blog. And sometimes I really hate this question, and I hate having to choose between languages.<br /><br />On one hand, writing and speaking in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Slovenian</span> is always easier for me, but by choosing Slovenian as the language for my content, I automatically limit myself to an audience of probably no more than 2 million people <span style="color: #999999;">(and the number is even smaller if you consider the number of Slovenian speaking people that are actually interested in what I&#8217;m writing about)</span>. The fact that a lot of the current tech terms (and buzzwords) don&#8217;t yet have a good Slovenian translation, also make my decision more difficult because I sometimes feel like I&#8217;m writing half in English anyway.<br /><br />On the other hand, I get a much bigger potential audience by writing in <span style="font-weight: bold;">English</span>, but it makes writing/speaking a bit more difficult, and it may also make my content more difficult to understand <span style="color: #999999;">(or maybe even relate to?)</span> for Slovenian people that don&#8217;t speak English well or at all. And although I consider myself fluent in English, I often feel a bit insecure or self-conscious when I write or speak in English <span style="color: #999999;">(especially for an audience of native speakers)</span>. The self-consciousness is even more apparent in synchronous communication situations - like IM or more recently with Second Life voice. When I blog or write emails I have the time to reflect, analyze, run a spellchecker, so I feel more confident <span style="color: #999999;">(though I always worry about making typos that could be interpreted as insufficient knowledge)</span>.<br /><br />But no matter which language I choose, there is always the question: should I <span style="font-weight: bold;">translate</span> this to the other language? And sometimes I do translate, but usually I don&#8217;t because I don&#8217;t have the time or motivation to do it - and let&#8217;s not forget that some things are always lost in translation no matter how hard you try. There is just so much good content out there that&#8217;s impossible to translate it all back and forth to one language and another.<br /><div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/1516677570/" title="Photo Sharing"><img alt="Languages" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2185/1516677570_de1d9f8b37_o.png" style="height: 186px; width: 303px;" /></a></div>So how can one deal with the language problem? I often choose English over Slovenian just because it helps me to get in touch with so many wonderful people around the globe, but I sometimes miss more discussions in my own language. And that is why on some levels I&#8217;m glad I can now also blog for my <a href="http://www.artesia.si/">company&#8217;s website</a> in Slovenian, but then again: I often wish I could share some of my Slovenian content with my English speaking friends&#8230; I guess the language question can never have just one answer. For me, it&#8217;s always a bit of a struggle, and in the end it&#8217;s up to each individual to choose his/her &#8220;side&#8221;. It isn&#8217;t easy, but I guess it&#8217;s one of the prices you have to pay to live in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_is_Flat">flat world</a>.<br /><br />I&#8217;d like to finish this post by turning to you, dear reader, and asking for your answers to the language question. If you&#8217;re not a native English speaker, how do you choose the language you write/speak in? And if you&#8217;re a native English speaker, how do you deal with all the non-English content on the web? Do you ignore it or try to understand it by turning to native speakers of the foreign language or by trying to learn a foreign language? I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts on the subject :)<br /><br /><span style="color: #999999;">(And by the way: one of my Slovenian friends answered the language question when he recently <a href="http://lisica.wordpress.com/2007/09/24/let-it-courier/">started his blog</a>, so I guess I&#8217;m not alone in the language dilemma :) )</span><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/10/musings-on-importance-of-speaking.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/10/musings-on-importance-of-speaking.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

Skitch offers different ways for getting images: you can take snapshots <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(it&#8217;s easy to capture just part of your screen)</span>, take a photo through your camera or work on any photo on your hard drive or on the web by dragging it into Skitch. Once you&#8217;ve got a photo in, you can add text and various shapes, and do a few basic edits. When you&#8217;re done, you can easily share it in any way you want. And what if you want to change the text or delete a shape later? No problem, you can always come back to the saved or uploaded images later and edit them again through Skitch <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(by the way - Skitch can also export images in the </span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">svg</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);"> format; apart from the standard jpg, png, pdf and tif of course)</span>.<br /><div align="center"><a href="http://myskitch.com/ialja/skitch_test-20071003-113531/"><img style="width: 312px; height: 236px;" src="http://myskitch.com/ialja/skitch_test-20071003-113531.png/preview.jpg" alt="Skitch test" /></a><br /><a style="font-family: Lucida Grande,Trebuchet,sans-serif,Helvetica,Arial; font-size: 10px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);" href="http://plasq.com/skitch">Uploaded with Skitch!</a></div>I saw the promo video of Skitch some time ago, but then I really didn&#8217;t imagine how great it is to actually use it.

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Recently, I&#8217;ve been spending a lot of time in <a href="http://www.secondlife.com/">Second Life</a> talking to new users, and also talking to companies/institutions that want to get into Second Life. And one thing my colleagues and I have noticed is that some Second Life myths are still very popular among people. That is why I think that it&#8217;s important to talk about what Second Life is and what Second Life isn&#8217;t with a good dose of realism. So, here is our list of some of common myths that should in our opinion be addressed in any serious meeting/discussion about Second Life (and other virtual worlds):<br /><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Second Life = Real Life.</span> Second Life is a just a virtual version of the real world with the same business models, customer needs and behavior. <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">WRONG</span></li></ul><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/1423633896/" title="Photo Sharing"><img style="width: 454px; height: 162px;" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1179/1423633896_3d942a7b40_o.png" alt="Second Life is not real life" /></a><br /></div>Many real world limitations don&#8217;t exist in Second Life. For this reason, the Second Life users have the freedom to behave differently than in the real world, satisfy different needs (for example, the need to have fantasy outfits) and literally take the world into their own hands.  Therefore it should come as no surprise that many established real world business and marketing models simply don&#8217;t work in SL. Real companies entering Second Life must get to know the virtual world and prove their value to the users.<br /><br /><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Second Life = the world wide web. </span><br />Like on the web, users in Second Life will visit my island to get information about my company/institution. <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">WRONG</span></li></ul><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/1423634112/" title="Photo Sharing"><img style="width: 413px; height: 159px;" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1034/1423634112_5f75c6df9f_o.png" alt="Second Life is not the world wide web" /></a><br /></div>Second Life residents are not in SL to receive the same kind of content in 3D as they could on the web. They are there for new experiences, not links to web sites. There is nothing worse for Second Life users than clicking an advertisement and being moved out of Second Life into a new browser window. Established web privacy/value trade-offs (for example, letting a company know your e-mail in exchange for a discount) must be re-evaluated and set based on specific usage.<br /><br /><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">It&#8217;s easy to make money in Second Life. </span>Second Life will, in a short time, grow my company profits or allow me a comfortable side income.<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(204, 0, 0);"> WRONG</span></li></ul><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/1422748331/" title="Photo Sharing"><img style="width: 356px; height: 160px;" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1173/1422748331_305b825735_o.png" alt="Second Life is not a money tree" /></a><br /></div>Yes, we do have money trees in Second Life, but don&#8217;t expect to get rich in SL with no effort. To make money, an individual or a company must be even more innovative and adaptable than in real world because of larger competition and a level playing field. Success requires time and effort. And don&#8217;t get in SL just with the vision of making money. Get in, enjoy the ride, and be inspired by what other are doing.<br /><br /><ul style="font-weight: bold;"><li>We know what works in Second Life and in what direction the future will take it. <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">WRONG</span></li></ul> <div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/1423634708/" title="Photo Sharing"><img style="width: 129px; height: 161px;" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1121/1423634708_a73d5f6210_o.png" alt="The future of Second Life is not clear" /></a><br /></div>Nobody has a Second LIfe crystal ball, which can tell us SL best practices and future developments of virtual worlds. You can&#8217;t even guarantee that Second Life will work when you&#8217;ve got an important demo scheduled! It is important to remember that virtual worlds are still in early development stages - think of the state of the world wide web in 1995. Don&#8217;t trust people that claim they&#8217;ve got all the answers, and check the figures; Second Life doesn&#8217;t have 10 million unique users! And just as we&#8217;re all still finding our way around Second Life, nobody can predict for sure what virtual worlds will look like in 5 or even 10 years. Could anybody predict BitTorrent, Facebook, YouTube or Flickr in the Mosaic age?<br /><br /><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">It&#8217;s useful for me/my company/my institution to start getting acquainted with Second Life.</span> <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">RIGHT</span></li></ul><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/1423635800/" title="Photo Sharing"><img style="width: 187px; height: 141px;" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1254/1423635800_01a0c1ed05_o.png" alt="Get a Second Life" /></a><br /></div>After the initial stages of experimentation, Second Life and virtual worlds will likely become a new way of communicating with colleagues, business partners, customers, friends and family and enable us a new way not only of doing business, but of living - just like mobile phones and the web have done in the past. Forward-looking companies/institutions and individuals that start learning about virtual worlds now will have an advantage in future. As I always say: there is no better way to understand a new technology than by trying it yourself. And I&#8217;d also suggest you to try different usages of Second Life. I might be spending a lot of time in Second Life for business/networking purposes, but I still find time for <a href="http://mindtracks.wordpress.com/2007/09/16/502/">fun explorations with friends</a>.<br /><br />I&#8217;d like to finish this post by adding some links to articles/resources that can also be useful when discussion Second Life and virtual worlds:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.informationweek.com/internet/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=201500141" target="_blank">Information Week: Five Rules For Bringing Your Real-Life Business Into Second Life</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://www.conference-board.org/utilities/pressDetail.cfm?press_ID=3205" target="_blank">Eight questions your company should ask when entering virtual worlds</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://www.fora.tv/searchresults.php?keywordsearch=Philip+Rosedale&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;page=1" target="_blank">Second Life: What Do We Learn If We Digitize EVERYTHING?</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://research.sun.com/projects/mc/mpk20.html" target="_blank">MPK20: Sun&#8217;s virtual Workplace</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://www.slcn.tv/metanomics-ibm-metaverse" target="_blank">IBM in the Metaverse</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://www.slcn.tv/metanomics-metanomics-101" target="_blank">Metanomics</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://www.zenentrepreneur.com/blog/2007/08/pioneers-and-virtual-entrepreneurship.html" target="_blank">Virtual Entrepreneurship in Second Life: the New Pioneers</a></li></ul><br />And what are in your experience the most common myths and misconceptions you have to deal with when talking about Second Life?<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/09/5-common-myths-about-second-life.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/09/5-common-myths-about-second-life.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

I&#8217;ve been using Moodle in different roles (admin, tutor, user) for quite some years now, and I believe that Moodle is a great platform for e-learning because it&#8217;s powerful, relatively easy to use, and also expandable and customizable for different needs. What is also great is the fact that the Moodle developer community is very active and always making sure new versions have useful new features and improvements of previous standard modules.<br /><br />I had the pleasure to attend <a href="http://dougiamas.com/" alt="Creator of Moodle">Martin Dougiamas</a>&#8217; virtual presentation about the <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Roadmap">future of Moodle</a> at the Austrian Moodle conference a few days ago, and I&#8217;m really excited about some of the features we&#8217;ll be soon seeing in version 1.9, and also the roadmap for Moodle 2.0, which in my opinion has the potential of making Moodle 2.0 a great member of the Web 2.0 family. In this post I&#8217;d like to share with you some of my thoughts on the future of Moodle. I believe that Moodle has a <a href="http://www.oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/cs-moodle.xml">sustainable future</a>, so I&#8217;ll focus mainly on discussing upcoming Moodle features and possible future developments.<br /><br />Among Moodle 1.9 features that Martin presented on Thursday, I was most impressed by the added <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Student_projects/Social_Networking_features">social networking features</a>. I think it&#8217;s a great step towards making Moodle even more flexible and user friendly. If you&#8217;re a <a href="http://www.moodle.org/">Moodle.org</a> site user, make sure you edit your profile and add your interests and try finding users with common interests <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(check out the page for the tag &#8221;</span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://moodle.org/tag/index.php?id=1">moodle</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">&#8221; - cool, isn&#8217;t it?)</span>. Right now I sometimes feel limited by the rigid course structure in Moodle, and I really can&#8217;t wait to have a better way to connect with other Moodle users through tags and shared interests <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(similar to what </span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://elgg.net/">Elgg</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);"> offers)</span>. And one of the next steps is hopefully the ability to mark Moodle items (forum posts, resources etc.) as favorites, so each user could create his/her own library of favorite resources.<br /><br />However, another problem I&#8217;ve been seeing with Moodle for some time now from the perspective of a common user (i.e. student role with no editing rights), was not just being closed in courses, but also being closed and limited to a certain Moodle site. I often found the thought that students lose access to their Moodle resources/activities/data after a course or study year is over disturbing. Of course, teachers have many options to export/import content and date, and move content/data among their courses and among Moodle sites. But the students don&#8217;t have any easy way to export their work and move it to a new Moodle site or to their personal archive somewhere else. So, I think one of the next steps in Moodle development should also be empowering users and enabling them to create their library of resources and also their Moodle portfolio that they (the students, not the teachers or administrators!) could take to another Moodle site (when changing schools for example). The Moodle development <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Roadmap">roadmap</a> shows plans of enabling easier connections between different Moodle sites through the <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Moodle_Network">Moodle Network</a>, which plans to provide a Moodle <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Community_hub">Community Hub</a> for sharing content, user info, and enabling better peer interaction. However, I think that moving between Moodles should also be made easy for students, and not just for the teachers.<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/images_en/c/ce/Community.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 444px; height: 208px;" src="http://docs.moodle.org/en/images_en/c/ce/Community.png" alt="" border="0" /></a><a style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Community_hub">Moodle Community Hub (from Moodle Docs)</a><br /></div>What I&#8217;d also like to see, is improvements in helping students getting around their Moodle courses. Moodle provides a block, which shows <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Recent_Activity">recent activity</a> since the last login for each course, and also an overview of your course through the <a href="http://docs.mjavascript/en/My_Moodle">My Moodle</a> page <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(though I really wonder how many administrators/teachers/students are aware of this option?)</span>. Still, I think the overview of my courses pages could and should be further improved by adding more flexibility and customization options. This could be very important for large Moodle sites with a lot of activity <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(like the moodle.org site, which I find very challenging to follow!)</span>. What I would like to see on the overview page is something closer to <a href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=2207967130">Facebook News feed page</a>. Students should be able to control what appears on this page, in what order, and in how much detail. Some sort of personal dashboard with more user-centric widgets. Now you can of course add some standard blocks to the overview page, but I miss more tools to help the users organize and plan their learning activities and perhaps an option to set up custom e-mail alerts that relate to specific course events. I really don&#8217;t like to receive e-mails for every Moodle post in a certain forum <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(especially for the most active ones)</span>, but I think it&#8217;d be useful to be able to add a rule to receive an e-mail update whenever a new resource/activity is posted (in any of courses you&#8217;re enrolled in) or when new topics that match your interests (keyword watcher) are started.<br /><br />All in all I&#8217;m really excited about Moodle adding more social networking features and establishing better connections between different Moodle installations and also the rest of the web. With all these improvements I&#8217;m beginning to wonder if in the future we could see Moodle also become a standardized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Learning_Environment">personal learning environment</a> with users in control of their learning data and the ability to move from one Moodle site to another <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(of course with the choice of moving only necessary portions of your Moodle profile data/library/portfolio)</span>? We&#8217;ll see what future Moodle development brings us. I certainly think Moodle is worth keeping an eye on, and I can&#8217;t wait to get my hands on the upcoming Moodle versions :)<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/09/random-thoughts-about-future-of-moodle.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/09/random-thoughts-about-future-of-moodle.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
As you might have already noticed, my job description on LinkedIn, Facebook and on my blog has changed. Yes, it&#8217;s true, after weeks of planning and considering different options I finally decided to try something new and co-found a company - <a href="http://www.artesia.si/">Artesia.si</a> that will specialize in 2D and 3D virtual communities. We will be offering consulting for companies wanting to improve or build virtual communities, and I will mostly focus on testing new technologies, planning and delivering (e)learning for our clients, and on presenting our company in <a href="http://www.secondlife.com/">Second Life</a>. At least for now we&#8217;ll be focusing on the Slovenian market, so we only have a <a href="http://www.artesia.si/">website</a> in Slovenian. But we do have a <a href="http://slurl.com/secondlife/Silicon%20City/208/159/28">virtual office</a> in Second Life that you can all visit <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(yeah, we&#8217;re a real flat world company with no brick and mortar office :) )</span>. And things are actually already moving faster than we could hope for. On Thursday we were invited to help with a piece on Second Life for the <a href="http://24ur.com/naslovnica/novice/it/20070830_3104625.php">evening news on national television</a> in Slovenia! I have the video with English subtitles on <a href="http://profile.to/iAlja">Facebook</a> if you&#8217;d like to see how it turned out :)<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RtiAH3LGxQI/AAAAAAAAAGw/zofJPUe3wx8/s1600-h/artesia+office.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 456px; height: 353px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RtiAH3LGxQI/AAAAAAAAAGw/zofJPUe3wx8/s400/artesia+office.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5104971050182427906" border="0" /></a>But despite the fact that I&#8217;m changing jobs, I still intend to keep this blog alive. It will still remain my personal learning space, on which I&#8217;ll be talking about my personal learning experiences, emerging technologies, and of course the occasional random thoughts of a geek :) So stay tuned, and if you&#8217;ve got more questions about my new professional adventure let me know!<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/08/starting-up-new-adventure.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/08/starting-up-new-adventure.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RtU703LGxPI/AAAAAAAAAGo/KYfvp77VzPY/s1600-h/information.png"><img style="margin: 0pt 5px 0px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RtU703LGxPI/AAAAAAAAAGo/KYfvp77VzPY/s400/information.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5104051532044092658" border="0" /></a>Lately I seem to be stumbling a common problem a lot while surfing the web, visiting different places in Second Life or just going to different analogue places by analogue roads. That problem is <span style="font-weight: bold;">lack of good directions</span> related to different content and places.<br /><br />A common example: I often find an interesting blog post, and when I try to find more about the person that wrote it or the  purpose of the blog, there is nothing. Nada. On blogs, I often get my hopes up when I see the &#8220;About&#8221; page, but too often I find the default message to the owner of the blog that no visitor should ever see <span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">(something like: &#8220;Write something about yourself/your blog on this page&#8221;)</span>. I really don&#8217;t expect everyone to provide their full CV and contact information, but even if you decide to be anonymous, you can at least tell us what field you work in and what is the purpose of the blog.<br /><br />Then another common example from Second Life. I won&#8217;t even mention those places that are supposed to have a grand opening and can&#8217;t be found anywhere on the map or under search. What I find even more disturbing is getting to a new place and receiving no clue of what the place is about and no help for getting easily from one part of the sim to the other (i.e. teleporters).  Flying is fun in Second Life, but I don&#8217;t always have the time or will to fly from one corner of the sim to the other to see there is nothing really interesting on the other side.<br /><br />The immediate <span style="font-weight: bold;">reaction</span> to the lack of (good) directions is for me confusion, self-consciousness <span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">(thoughts like: are there really no directions here or is it my fault that I can&#8217;t find them?)</span>, and the final result is usually leaving the confusing place without plans to return in the near future. This confusing place should of course never be your online course site, your virtual world presence, or even your personal or professional website.<br /><br />So, <span style="font-weight: bold;">what can we do</span> to avoid users leaving our places, and how can we prepare good directions for our users (students, clients or friends)? Having really good directions is not an easy job I grant you, but I think there are some things we can do to get closer to that goal:<br /><ul><li>The first step is of course <span style="font-weight: bold;">recognizing that some directions are needed</span>. In our enthusiasm of building something new we often forget that.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Think like a newbie and like an average user </span>of your content when preparing directions, and (if possible) <span style="font-weight: bold;">test</span> them on a random person that was not involved in the design process and is not a super geek. If your grandparents can understand your directions you&#8217;re certainly on the right track!</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Make directions easy to read</span>, help yourself with simple <span style="font-weight: bold;">visual clues</span> (a map, icons etc.). Keep it <span style="font-weight: bold;">simple</span> and try to include the <span style="font-weight: bold;">basic information.</span> First time users/visitors don&#8217;t need to know all the details, but they should be able to get to those later when they need them.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Make directions visible for first time visitor, but not disturbing to frequent visitors</span>. Avoid using intrusive tools such as pop-up messages. The first time user might appreciate them, but only the first time. On the second visit he/she will start looking for the mute button, on the forth he/she will start looking for excuses for not visiting. </li><li>Not all directions should look like they&#8217;re there just because they have to be there. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Add value</span>: entertain your visitor, provide additional functions (i.e. teleporting in Second Life, a list of the most interesting posts etc.), make them feel welcome and appreciated.</li><li>Be polite to all users, not just those that you want to have today or those that pay you. You never know when you&#8217;ll need somebody, so try to <span style="font-weight: bold;">make a good first impression on everyone</span>.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Provide personal support options</span>. Even if you don&#8217;t manage to give good directions, you can be saved by giving your users/visitors/students and easy way to contact you and get personal directions from you or your staff. It&#8217;s the age of a user-centric web, on which we like the feeling we can all go talk to the boss if we want to.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Listen to user feedback.</span> And don&#8217;t listen just to the users that talk to you. Sometimes you have to make the first step and ask the users for feedback.</li></ul>These are just some of my guideliness for designing good directions (that don&#8217;t apply just to giving directions on the internet, but should also be considered in offline spaces!), but I would of course love to hear how you approach the task of providing good directions for your users. How do you, for example, provide directions for the students of your course or visitors of your website, online profile or blog?<br /><br />On my blog, I try to provide good directions by having a &#8220;Who am I?&#8221; block right on the top of the blog sidebar, which has some basic info about me and a few links to my extended profiles if the visitors want to know more about me. Also, I decided to visualize my blog purpose with a simple moto <span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">(Click. Learn. Share.)</span> and icons right below. I might also add some links to my most interesting posts in the future, but overall I hope I did a decent job in providing directions and different ways for navigation. If you think I&#8217;m missing something, please let me know :)<br /><br />I certainly think that once in a while we should all stop to think about how new users feel when they first enter one of our places. And I think we can often find some little and sweet details to add that will make the visiting experience for first-timers and regulars alike that more pleasurable and memorable.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/08/giving-good-directions.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/08/giving-good-directions.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

After a lovely Greek vacation <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(I highly recommed Greece for vacation - great food, great people, crystal clear sea!)</span> I had one of the busiest week (and weekend) ever: all the catching up with RSS feeds, mails + intensive work on two different projects&#8230; and the result of that is that I still haven&#8217;t managed to reply to all mails <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(bad Alja, bad!)</span>, and I&#8217;m also late for my blogger homework, which was assigned to me by <a href="http://www.bretagdesigns.com/technologist/?p=334">The Four Eyed Technologist</a> 12 days ago <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(so says </span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://www.technorati.com/blogs/ialja.blogspot.com?reactions">Technorati</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);"> :) )</span>. So, it&#8217;s now time to stop making excuses and join the &#8220;8 Random Things&#8221; game that has been spreading around the blogosphere for quite some time now. I admit that I&#8217;ve been reading many random things about many of you in the past weeks with quite some interest, so it&#8217;s only fair to do my share now :)<br /><br />First, <span style="font-weight: bold;">The rules:</span><br /><ol><li>Post these rules before you give your facts.</li><li>List 8 random facts about yourself.</li><li>At the end of your post, choose (tag) 8 people and list their names, linking to them.</li><li>Leave a comment on their blog, letting them know they’ve been tagged.</li></ol><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">My 8 Random Things:</span><br /><ol><li>I trained track and field athletics for about 10 years in different disciplines; I started in first grade in long distances, and ended up doing long jump and 60m/100m hurdles. I wasn&#8217;t too bad at it <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(even got into the national team once)</span>, but I quit because I lost my interest in competitions.</li><li>At the end of elementary school I wanted to study chemistry, but then lost all interest for it in high school and turned towards computer and social sciences.<br /></li><li>I love animation movies and cartoons in general. On my top list are Pixar movies <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(</span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://www.pixar.com/shorts/ftb/index.html">this short one</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);"> is imho enough to explain the brilliance of Pixar)</span> and Japanese sci-fi animes, but I like to watch just any animated thing that pops on screen.</li><li>I don&#8217;t like travelling much, especially by car. I keep hoping teleport systems will be invented in my lifetime :)</li><li>My interested for education highly derives from the fact that I was bored at school 90 % of the time, and I spent most of that time drawing various sketches in my notebooks.</li><li>I am shortsighted - couldn&#8217;t get far through the day without glasses or contact lenses! Part of it is inherited, and part of it is the price of being a computer geek and living behind computer screens.</li><li>I love the sea; now that I don&#8217;t live by the sea anymore, I really miss the sea air, and the wind you only get on the coast&#8230; And thinking of that always reminds me of the song &#8221;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gente_Di_Mare">Gente di mare</a>&#8221;.</li><li>I had compulsory Italian classes for 12 years in school as I lived in a bilingual zone (near the Slovenian-Italian border).
